#' Interpret and Describe Causal Effect Estimates
#'
#' This function interprets the output of the `group_tab` function, providing textual descriptions of causal effect estimates. It categorizes the strength of evidence for causality based on E-values and confidence intervals, and generates a detailed interpretation of the effect estimates according to specified causal scales and estimands.
#'
#' @param df Data frame output from `group_tab` containing categorized causal effect estimates.
#' @param causal_scale Character string specifying the causal scale used in the analysis, currently only supports "causal_difference". Future versions may include additional scales.
#' @param estimand Character string indicating the type of causal estimand interpreted: "PATE" (Population Average Treatment Effect), "ATE" (Average Treatment Effect), "ATT" (Average Treatment Effect in the Treated), or "CATE" (Conditional Average Treatment Effect).
#'
#' @return A character vector containing a detailed interpretation of each outcome in `df`, including the type of estimand, the causal contrast, E-values, and the strength of evidence for causality.

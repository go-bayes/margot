#' Interpret and Describe Causal Effect Estimates Using E-values
#'
#' This function interprets the output of causal effect analysis, providing textual descriptions
#' of causal effect estimates. It categorises the strength of evidence for causality based on
#' E-values and confidence intervals, and generates a detailed interpretation of the effect
#' estimates according to specified causal scales (i.e., "causal_difference" or "risk_ratio")
#' and estimands. This function now supports interpreting results on both the causal difference
#' and risk ratio scales.
#'
#' @param df Data frame containing causal effect estimates, expected to include columns for
#' outcome names, effect estimates (either differences or ratios), confidence intervals,
#' E-values, and a summary estimate label. The structure of `df` should align with the specified
#' `causal_scale`.
#' @param causal_scale Character string specifying the causal scale used in the analysis.
#' Currently supports "causal_difference" for differences in means or medians, and "risk_ratio"
#' for comparing ratios of probabilities or risks.
#' @param estimand Character string indicating the type of causal estimand interpreted: "PATE"
#' (Population Average Treatment Effect), "ATE" (Average Treatment Effect), "ATT" (Average
#' Treatment Effect in the Treated), or "CATE" (Conditional Average Treatment Effect).
#'
#' @return A character vector containing a detailed interpretation of each outcome in `df`,
#' including the type of estimand, the causal contrast, E-values, and the strength of evidence
#' for causality. The interpretation includes whether there is evidence for causality based on
#' the E-value and confidence interval, tailored to the specified causal scale.

#' Interpret Policy Tree Results
#'
#' This function creates an interpretation of policy tree results from a causal forest or multi-arm causal forest model.
#' It generates a formatted description of the policy tree, including the main splits and recommended actions.
#'
#' @param mc_test A list containing the results from a multi-arm causal forest model.
#' @param model_name A string specifying which model's results to interpret.
#' @param train_proportion Numeric value between 0 and 1 for the proportion of data used for training. Default is 0.8.
#' @param custom_action_names Optional vector of custom names for the actions. Must match the number of actions in the policy tree.
#' @param format A string specifying the output format. Either "markdown" (default) or "latex".
#'
#' @return Invisibly returns a string containing the interpretation in the specified format.
#'   The function also prints the interpretation to the console.

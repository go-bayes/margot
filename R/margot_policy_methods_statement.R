#' Policy Learning Methods Statement
#'
#' Generates a boilerplate methods paragraph describing the policy learning
#' workflow used for policy trees in `margot` (DR scores, tree fitting, honest
#' evaluation, policy value contrasts with bootstrap CIs, treated-only uplift,
#' and optional stability analysis).
#'
#' @param object A `margot_stability_policy_tree` (preferred) or a list with
#'   `$results` created by `margot_policy_tree()`.
#' @param depth Integer; tree depth described in text (default 2).
#' @param include_stability Logical; add details on the stability analysis if
#'   available (default TRUE).
#' @param include_policy_value Logical; mention policy value contrasts and CIs
#'   (default TRUE).
#' @param include_treated_only Logical; mention treated-only uplift and coverage
#'   (default FALSE).
#' @param citations Logical; include inline citations (author-year) (default TRUE).
#' @param style Character; one of "short" (1 paragraph) or "long" (multi-line)
#'   (default "short").
#' @return A character scalar with the methods paragraph(s).

#' Double Robust Marginal Estimation and Tabulation
#'
#' This function provides a double robust approach for estimating causal effects. It first computes
#' marginal effects using the `causal_contrast_marginal` function, then processes and tabulates these
#' results using `tab_engine_marginal`. The function handles both continuous and categorical variables,
#' and allows specification of the type of effect measure for both causal estimation and tabulation.
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing the dataset for analysis.
#' @param Y The name of the outcome variable as a string.
#' @param X The name of the treatment or exposure variable as a string.
#' @param baseline_vars A vector of covariate names included in the model.
#' @param treat_0 The reference level of the treatment variable.
#' @param treat_1 The treatment level of the treatment variable.
#' @param nsims The number of simulations to run, used in bootstrap or Monte Carlo methods.
#' @param cores The number of processor cores to use for parallel computation.
#' @param family A description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model.
#' @param weights Logical, indicating whether to use weighting in the model estimation.
#' @param continuous_X Logical, indicating whether the treatment variable X is continuous.
#' @param splines Logical, indicating whether to use spline functions for continuous variables.
#' @param vcov The method to use for variance-covariance estimation.
#' @param verbose Logical, indicating whether to print detailed output during computation.
#' @param delta The assumed smallest worthwhile effect, used for E-value calculations in tabulation.
#' @param sd The standard deviation of the effect estimate, used for E-value calculations.
#' @param new_name A new name to assign to the tabulated output, typically describing the variable or model.
#' @param estimand Specifies the target of the causal inference, such as "ATE" (Average Treatment Effect) or "ATT" (Average Treatment on the Treated).
#' @param type_causal The type of effect size (e.g., "RR" for Risk Ratio or "RD" for Risk Difference) to be computed in the causal analysis.
#' @param type_tab The type of effect size to be used in the tabulation of results.
#'
#' @return A list containing two elements: `causal_results` with the results from the causal analysis, and
#'         `tab_results` with the tabulated results including E-values and other statistics.

#' Simulate Data for Average Treatment Effect (ATE) with Sample Weights
#'
#' Generates simulated data for a sample and a population to study average treatment effects (ATE),
#' considering the presence of an effect modifier. The function simulates differences in the
#' distribution of effect modifiers between the sample and the population without altering the treatment
#' effect or the effect-modification. Weights are calculated to adjust for the distribution differences
#' of the effect modifier between the sample and the population.
#'
#' @param n_sample Integer, the size of the sample. Default is 10000.
#' @param n_population Integer, the size of the population. Default is 100000.
#' @param p_z_sample Numeric, the probability of the effect modifier in the sample. Default is 0.1.
#' @param p_z_population Numeric, the probability of the effect modifier in the population. Default is 0.5.
#' @param beta_a Numeric, the treatment effect. Default is 1.
#' @param beta_z Numeric, the coefficient of the effect modifier. Default is 2.5.
#' @param beta_az Numeric, the interaction term representing the effect modification of treatment by the effect modifier. Default is 0.5.
#' @param noise_sd Numeric, the standard deviation of the noise in the outcome variable. Default is 0.5.
#' @param seed Optional. An integer value for setting the seed to ensure reproducibility. Default is `NULL`, which does not set a seed.
#'
#' @return A list containing two data frames: `sample_data` and `population_data`, each comprising the outcome variable `y`, the treatment variable `a`, and the effect modifier `z`. The `sample_data` data frame also includes the calculated weights for each observation.

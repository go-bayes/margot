# [2024-08-7] margot 0.2.0.4

## New
* `margot_process_longitudinal_data` orders correctly for `lmtp` models by updating the censoring column `not_lost` such that it handles missing responses as well as attrition. The function additionally automatically dummy codes ordinal variables and standardises continuous variables. Presently it is only implemented for three waves, but in the future it will be expanded to handle arbitrarily many. 

## Fixed
* Functions `compute_qini_curves` and `extract_qini_data` to work with binary interventions

# [2024-08-7] margot 0.2.0.3

## New

* `margot_summary_tables` creates summary tables of baseline variables, exposure(s), and outcome(s) using the `gtsummary` package.

## Deprecations

* `margot_compute_gender_weights` is deprecated. Now use `margot_compute_gender_weights_by_wave`.


# [2024-08-7] margot 0.2.0.2
## Deprecations

* `coloured_histogram()` and `coloured_histogram_quantile()` are deprecated.
  Now use the new `margot_plot_hist()` instead.
* `create_ordered_variable_custom` is deprecated. Now use `created_ordered_variable`function with `custom_breaks = c(..)` to obtain custom breaks. 

## New
* `margot_plot_hist()` for plotting distributions of the exposure variable


# margot 0.2.0.1
* new table and plot functions for `grf` outputs

# margot 0.2.0

* improved subgroup comparison function 
* deprecated `compare_group_means` function, with `compare_group`allowing for contrasts of on both the causal difference and relative risk scales.
* new wrapper functions functions for `grf` plus visualising results.


# margot 0.1.2.1
* group_tab now works under the hood of margot_plot, so no need to specify explicitly
* group_tab now allows custom order for plot, not just by decreasing effect size
* numerous small enhancements to older parametric model options
* new logo

# margot 0.1.2

* minor fixes


# margot 0.1.1

* functions to interpret outputs of `lmtp` models
* functions to create tables
* functions to create graphs

# margot 0.1.0.1

* Minor bug fixes and performance improvements.


# margot 0.1.0

* Initial release: includes data exploration, model preparation, utility functions.

# [2025-10-03] margot 1.0.256
### Changed
- **Removed**: `gc()` call from worker cleanup in `margot_lmtp()` - let R manage memory naturally instead of forcing aggressive garbage collection
- **Added**: CLI message showing how many cores are being used when `manage_future_plan = TRUE`
- **Documentation**: Added `@details` section explaining that very large models may not benefit from parallelization due to memory constraints

# [2025-10-02] margot 1.0.255
### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: `margot_lmtp()` now explicitly shuts down all parallel workers when `manage_future_plan = TRUE` to prevent zombie processes and resource leaks
- **CRITICAL**: Removed overly aggressive thread limiting (OMP_NUM_THREADS) that was causing worker startup failures
- Added `gc()` call after worker shutdown to ensure memory cleanup
- Added CLI message "Shutting down parallel workers..." for transparency

### Changed
- Worker cleanup now always sets `future::plan(sequential)` on exit, regardless of initial plan state

# [2025-10-02] margot 1.0.254
### Performance Improvements
- **CRITICAL FIX**: `margot_lmtp()` now respects user's external `future::plan()` when `manage_future_plan = FALSE` (default), enabling parallel cross-validation within each model (~5x speedup)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed `future::plan(sequential)` override that was disabling all parallelization when `manage_future_plan = FALSE`
- **Fixed**: Set `mc.cores` and `parallelly.maxWorkers.localhost` early when `manage_future_plan = TRUE` to prevent "only 1 CPU cores available" errors with nested futures
- **Fixed**: User interrupts (Ctrl+C) now work correctly - removed interrupt detection code that was catching interrupts as errors

### Changed
- `margot_lmtp()`: When `manage_future_plan = FALSE`, models run sequentially but each model can now use user's future plan for parallel CV
- `margot_lmtp()`: Improved CLI diagnostics show whether LMTP internal parallelization is enabled and how many workers are available
- `margot_lmtp()`: Treatment variable preflight check now handles character vectors properly and provides better error messages

### Expected Performance
- **With external future plan**: Set `future::plan(multisession, workers = 5)` before calling `margot_lmtp()` with default `manage_future_plan = FALSE` → ~5x faster (sequential models, parallel CV)
- **With managed nested futures**: Use `margot_lmtp(..., manage_future_plan = TRUE, cv_workers = 5, n_cores = 12)` → ~10x faster (2 models × 5 CV workers = 10 cores)

# [2025-10-02] margot 1.0.253
### Breaking Changes
- None

### Added
- `margot_lmtp()`: incremental checkpointing system saves each model immediately after completion to timestamped subdirectory (`save_path/checkpoints/prefix_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`), protecting against power failures and interruptions.
- `margot_lmtp()`: preflight validation checks all required variables (treatment, outcomes, baseline, time_vary, cens) exist in data before expensive computation begins.
- `margot_lmtp()`: enhanced error messages showing available variables when validation fails.

### Fixed
- `margot_lmtp()`: future parallelization conflicts resolved. When `manage_future_plan = FALSE`, explicitly sets sequential outer loop while preserving user's `future::plan()` for LMTP's internal cross-validation.
- `margot_lmtp()`: null model validation crash fixed. Now checks null model exists and is valid before computing contrasts, preventing "attempt to select less than one element" error.
- `margot_lmtp()`: error logs saved to checkpoint directory for failed models.

### Improved
- `margot_lmtp()`: checkpoint saves use `qs::qsave()` with high compression and single thread for compatibility with future parallelization.
- `margot_lmtp()`: CLI messages show checkpoint directory path and individual file saves.
- `margot_lmtp()`: preflight checks provide detailed feedback on missing variables with suggestions.

# [2025-10-02] margot 1.0.252
### Breaking Changes
- **LMTP positivity diagnostics now focus on uncensored observations**: `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()` reports ESS metrics computed only on density ratios > 0 (uncensored observations). Censoring rate (proportion of r = 0) is reported separately per shift.
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: output format changed. Each shift line now shows: `censoring = X%; uncensored ESS by wave — ...`.
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: internal `summarise_shift()` now returns `ess_pos`, `ess_pos_frac`, `n_all`, `n_pos`, `prop_censored` instead of `ess`, `ess_frac`, `n`.
- **LMTP density ratio plots now show only uncensored observations by default**: `margot_lmtp_overlap()` and `margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid()` histograms exclude zeros (r = 0) by default. Use `show_censored = TRUE` to include zeros. Plot titles now indicate "uncensored | censored: X%" or "censored: X%" depending on parameter.

### Conceptual Change
- **Zeros in LMTP density ratios primarily reflect censoring, not positivity violations**: Following expert guidance, zeros (r = 0) in longitudinal LMTP density ratios arise when individuals drop out (censored) and have no treatment observed at subsequent waves. These censoring-induced zeros appear identically across all policies. True treatment positivity violations are policy-specific. Therefore, ESS and distributional diagnostics should focus on uncensored observations (r > 0) to assess positivity where treatment was actually observed.

### Added
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: methods section (`include_methods = TRUE`) now includes "Censoring vs. Treatment Positivity" subsection explaining the distinction and rationale for focusing on uncensored observations.
- `margot_lmtp_positivity()`: enhanced documentation explaining censoring vs. treatment positivity and the role of `*_pos` columns. Now computes `min_pos`, `max_pos`, `mean_pos`, `sd_pos`, `cv_pos` for uncensored observations.
- `margot_lmtp_overlap()` and `margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid()`: new `show_censored` parameter (default: FALSE) controls whether zeros are included in histograms.

### Improved
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: header now reads "LMTP positivity diagnostics for [outcome] (uncensored observations)."
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: detailed diagnostics (`include_diagnostics = TRUE`) now use `*_pos` columns (range_pos, mean_pos, sd_pos, cv_pos, q*_pos, p_gt_*_pos) from `margot_lmtp_positivity()` and display "Censoring rate" separately.
- Per-shift lines now clearly distinguish censoring rate from uncensored ESS metrics for better interpretability.
- `margot_lmtp_overlap()`: plot titles clarify whether showing uncensored observations or all observations with censoring rate.
- All LMTP positivity/overlap documentation updated to explain censoring vs. treatment positivity distinction.

# [2025-10-01] margot 1.0.251
### Breaking Changes
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: removed `include_overview` parameter. Averaging statistics across interventions is incoherent and has been removed.

### Added
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: new `include_methods` parameter (default: FALSE) prepends methodological explanation of density ratios, their interpretation as rebalancing weights, and ESS computation formula.
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: new `include_diagnostics` parameter (default: FALSE) appends detailed diagnostics per shift including zeros, range, mean ± SD, CV, tail probabilities, and quantiles. Uses `margot_lmtp_positivity()` internally.

### Improved
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: all mathematical notation now uses LaTeX formatting (e.g., `$r_t > 1$`, `$\text{ESS} = (\sum w)^2 / \sum w^2$`) for proper rendering in Quarto markdown.
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: removed redundant "ESS computed from raw density ratios using colSums" text from header.
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()`: when `return = "list"`, now includes `$methods` and `$diagnostics` components for programmatic access.

# [2025-10-01] margot 1.0.250
### Breaking Changes
- `margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid()` and `margot_lmtp_overlap_plot_grid()`: replaced `annotate_wave` and `annotate_shift` parameters with unified `annotate_graph` parameter accepting "none", "waves", or "shifts".
- `margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid()` and `margot_lmtp_overlap_plot_grid()`: replaced `ymax_by_wave` with more flexible `ymax_harmonize` parameter accepting "none" (default), "row", "column", "global", or custom named vectors.
- Removed `remove_waves` parameter; use `waves` parameter for positive selection instead.

### Added
- `xlim_harmonize` parameter for x-axis harmonization in `margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid()` and `margot_lmtp_overlap_plot_grid()` with options: "none" (default), "row", "column", "global", or custom values.
- Automatic colour detection for shifts in `margot_lmtp_overlap()`: shifts containing "null" → grey (#7f7f7f), "up" → orange (#d95f0e), "down" → blue (#2c7fb8).
- Layout-aware axis harmonization: "row" and "column" options intelligently adapt based on whether rows/columns represent waves or shifts.

### Improved
- Default `headroom` increased from 0.06 to 0.12 for better annotation visibility.
- Annotation positioning adjusted (vjust = 1.2) for clearer wave/shift labels at top of plots.
- Updated "lab" palette alias to match automatic shift colours.
- Fixed `annotate_zeros` documentation to correctly reflect logical (TRUE/FALSE) implementation.
- Added `@param waves` documentation to wrapper function.

# [2025-09-30] margot 1.0.249
### Added
- `margot_plot_lmtp_learners()` heatmap summarising Super Learner weights by wave/component.
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_learners()` prose helper that highlights dominant learners (e.g., LOCF-driven collapses).
- `margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid()` now accepts `color_by`, `fill_palette`, and `text_size` to control histogram aesthetics.

# [2025-09-30] margot 1.0.248
### Changed
- Introduced `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()` for colSums-based ESS summaries by wave and overall, replacing the earlier zero-focused reporting.
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_overlap()` now forwards to the new helper with a soft-deprecation warning to ease migration.
- pkgdown reference navigation now lists `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()` in place of the deprecated alias.
- Removed redundant positivity helper wrappers (`margot_positivity_panel()`, `margot_positivity_tails_panel()`, `margot_lmtp_ratio_multigrid()`, `margot_plot_lmtp_positivity()`, `margot_plot_lmtp_positivity_batch()`).

# [2025-09-29] margot 1.0.247
### New
- `margot_overlap_bullets()` reports positivity results
- `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity_overview`() - compares results

### Improved
- `margot_report_lmtp_positivity()` now uses label_mapping to pretty‑print the outcome in plot
  titles and returns outcome_label in the report list.
- Grid improvements
      - Rows can be annotated with wave labels: `annotate_wave = "facet"`.
      - Optional wave‑based `coloring: color_by_wave = TRUE` (distinct fill per wave).
      - Both available via margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid().
  - Compact by‑wave table
      - Reporter now returns `by_wave_ess_compact` as a slim Wave × Shift table (e.g., Wave | Shift Up |
  Shift Down | Null).
      - Also returns `n_participants` (baseline participants) and `n_person_time` (pooled rows).


# [2025-09-28] margot 1.0.246

### New

- `margot_report_lmtp_positivity()`: one‑stop reporter for LMTP positivity diagnostics that returns overall tables, combined by‑wave tables (ESS/N and ESS), optional density‑ratio grids with harmonised or custom y‑limits, and filtered flags. Backwards‑compatible alias `margot_lmtp_positivity_report()` is provided.
- `margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid()`: wrapper for wave‑by‑shift density‑ratio grids with optional y‑axis control.
- `margot_plot_lmtp_positivity()`: quick ggplots for overall ESS/N (bar) and ESS/N by wave (line) from the positivity reporter.
- `margot_plot_lmtp_positivity_batch()`: run the positivity reporter/plots across multiple analyses in one call.

### Improvements
- `margot_lmtp_overlap_plot_grid()` now harmonises y‑axis heights across panels and accepts a `ymax` override to force comparable histogram scales across waves or shifts.

# [2025-09-27] margot 1.0.245

### New
- `margot_positivity_panel()`: compact positivity summary (all vs positive-only) for LMTP models.
- `margot_positivity_tails_panel()`: detailed quantiles and tail probabilities (all vs positive-only).
- `margot_lmtp_overlap()`: LMTP overlap/positivity helper built on `margot_lmtp_positivity()`, with optional density-ratio plots and scale toggle.
- `margot_lmtp_ratio_grid()`: panel grid of per-wave density-ratio histograms for a selected outcome/shift.
- `margot_lmtp_ratio_multigrid()`: multi-shift facet grid (waves x shifts) of density ratios for a selected outcome; supports label mapping and log10/linear scales.
- `margot_lmtp_overlap_plot_grid()`: arrange `margot_lmtp_overlap()` ratio_plots into a wave-by-shift grid for a single outcome; supports ordering and title control.
- `margot_grf_overlap()`: new name for GRF overlap diagnostics (wraps existing functionality).

### Changes
- `margot_assess_overlap()` is soft-deprecated; please use `margot_grf_overlap()` instead.
- `margot_lmtp_overlap()` plots now accept `scale = "log10"` (default) or `scale = "linear"` and no longer take `save_plots`/`output_dir` (return ggplot objects to save externally).

# [2025-09-26] margot 1.0.244

### Improvements
- `margot_lmtp()` batches outcome/shift fits with nested future parallelism, prioritises fold workers, and adds `models_in_parallel`/`cv_workers` controls plus clearer scheduling messages. (note, nested future parrallelism not yet working; lmtp
'listens' to sequential parrallel setting, slowing its cross validation (to be continued...))

### Bug Fixes
- Stabilised nested future plans on macOS by provisioning dedicated multisession layers for outer/inner work so batches no longer trigger `UnexpectedFutureResultError`.

# [2025-09-19] margot 1.0.243

- `margot_lmtp_positivity()` - reports positivity in lmtp models

# [2025-09-19] margot 1.0.242

### New: 
- `margot_policy_workflow()`, shared explainer

### Improvements: 
- min_gain_for_depth_switch, audience + return_unit_masks, brief includes Depth, bugfix for depth-1 in summary table, interpretation reuse flags

# [2025-09-19] margot 1.0.240 - 1.0.241

### Improvements
- `margot_policy_tree_stability()` adds `compute_policy_values` (with `policy_value_R`, `policy_value_seed`, `policy_value_baseline`) to pre-compute bootstrap policy gains and now recognises the legacy `parrallel` flag.
- `margot_policy_tree_stability()` allows tuning `future.globals.maxSize` via `future_globals_max_size` (20 GiB default) so large stability jobs can run in parallel without hitting the future globals guard.
- Cached policy gains include baseline/contrast metadata for downstream reporters; internal fallback `.compute_policy_value_internal()` keeps stand-alone scripts working.
- `margot_policy_summary_report()` adds a "Practical Takeaways" block, per-model depth overrides (`depths_by_model`), depth-specific model lists/maps, recommended id/name outputs by depth, and compact-table controls (`split_drop_zero`, `split_top_only`) while fixing the missing-object error.
- `margot_policy_summary_compare_depths()` is now exported and documented alongside the updated policy reporting workflow, returning a mixed-depth report (`best_summary`) plus depth maps/lists for downstream plotting.
- `margot_interpret_policy_batch()` accepts `depths_by_model`, surfaces per-model depths, and returns the depth map when `return_as_list = TRUE`.
- `margot_policy_summary_report()` better support for quarto markdown.
 

# [2025-09-19] margot 1.0.239
### Improvements
- `margot_policy_summary_report()` better support for quarto markdown.wn.
 
# [2025-09-19] margot 1.0.238
### Improvements
- `margot_policy_summary_report()` better summary of policy-tree results
 
 
# [2025-09-19] margot 1.0.237

### Improvements
- `margot_policy_summary_report()` outputs model id's for wins/neutral/caution, to make reporting of policy trees easier
- `margot_policy_summary_report()` now returns a narrative `report` field summarising wins, neutral, and caution models for manuscript-ready text
- `margot_policy_summary_report()` also includes a compact `interpretation` paragraph that lists wins, caution models, and uncertain outcomes

# [2025-09-18] margot 1.0.236

### New
- Added `margot_report_consensus_policy_value()` to report consensus policy value vs treat-all and control-all with 95% CIs (bootstrap). Supports `label_mapping` and optional treated-only metrics.
- Added `margot_table_consensus_policy_value()` to create a rounded, manuscript-ready table from the reporter output (includes treated-only metrics when present).
- Added `margot_table_treated_only()` to produce a condensed, treated-only summary table: average uplift among treated (with CI when available) and coverage treated (%).
- Added `margot_policy_summary_report()` to generate a grouped summary text and a markdown table for all models at a chosen depth. Supports `report_df` to avoid recomputation, grouping by sign (Wins/Neutral/Caution), ordering, filtering, verbose progress, and optional original-scale annotations via `original_df`.
- Added `margot_policy_methods_statement()` to generate a standard policy-learning methods paragraph (DR scores, policy trees, honest evaluation, policy value CIs, treated-only uplift, optional stability).

### Interpreter enhancements
- `margot_interpret_policy_tree()` and `margot_interpret_policy_batch()` now accept `report_policy_value = "treated_only"` to focus on treated subgroups. The narrative includes “Avg uplift among treated,” with a bootstrap CI.
- Batch interpreter (`margot_interpret_policy_batch`) can return both a brief treated-only summary and the full report via `return_as_list = TRUE` (list elements: `report_brief`, `report_full`, `by_model`, and `policy_value_explanation`).
- Optional one-line treated-only summary per model (`brief = TRUE`).
- Rich leaf reporting is preserved even when conditional means are missing by falling back to DR scores on the test set.

### Stability + summary
- `summary.margot_stability_policy_tree()` can control bootstrap settings for consensus policy value via `policy_value_R`, `policy_value_seed`, and `show_policy_value`.

### Improvements
- Reporter and tables accept `label_mapping` for display labels; reporter also includes an `outcome_label` column.
- Baseline computation for policy value corrected to use explicit control/treatment means; removed inappropriate use of ATE.
- Policy tree learning/evaluation consistently uses `dr_scores` (flipping is for reporting only).
- Small UI polish (better evaluation messages) and rounding in tables (3 d.p.).
- `margot_policy_summary_report()` returns grouped brief tables as data frames (`group_table`) and a single combined data frame with a `group` column (`group_table_df`) to facilitate downstream export.
- Renamed internal columns to be syntactic (e.g., `coverage_treated_pct`) to avoid build errors.

### Notes
- All changes are backward compatible. Defaults preserved; new features are opt-in.

# [2025-09-17] margot 1.0.235
- **Improved** `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()` now return 'permitted_model_ds' for use with policytree analysis.


# [2025-09-01] margot 1.0.234
- **Returned** `read_multiple_images()` utility for quarto presentations/documents


# [2025-08-11] margot 1.0.233
- **Returned** `simulate_ate_data_with_weights()` to exports for teaching. 

# [2025-08-10] margot 1.0.232

### New
- Added **`margot_resort_contrast_lmtp`**
  - Flipping the effect estimates - Changes the sign of E[Y(1)]-E[Y(0)]
  - Swapping confidence intervals - Properly reverses and swaps the 2.5% and 97.5% bounds
  - Recalculating E-values - updates these based on the flipped estimates 
- **`margot_view_lmtp_structure()`**: view contrasts

# [2025-08-10] margot 1.0.231

### New Features
- **Added `margot_naive_regressions()` function**:
  - Performs naive cross-sectional linear regressions for educational/comparison purposes
  - Processes multiple outcomes with robust error handling - continues processing even if individual outcomes fail
  - Includes `coefficient_scale` parameter for multi-unit change interpretations (e.g., 4-unit changes)
  - Calculates approximate E-values based on effect sizes when EValue package compatibility issues occur
  - Output structure compatible with `margot_plot()` for seamless integration with existing workflows
  - Uses `"E[Y|A]"` notation to clearly indicate these are conditional expectations, not causal effects
  - Includes appropriate warnings about confounding and non-causal interpretation

# [2025-08-08] margot 1.0.230

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Improved coefficient alignment in `margot_plot()`**:
  - Coefficients are now positioned at a fixed location along the inside edge of the plot area
  - Creates consistent vertical alignment of coefficient values regardless of where data points fall
  - Uses 5% offset from left edge of plot area with left-aligned text for optimal readability
  - Eliminates the scattered coefficient positioning that varied based on individual data point locations

# [2025-08-03] margot 1.0.229

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed incorrect back-transformation for log+z transformed variables in margot_plot()**:
  - Updated `back_transform_estimates()` to properly use `back_transform_log_z()` for variables that have been both log-transformed and z-scored
  - This fixes the issue where hours variables were incorrectly transformed to minutes (e.g., showing 7,711 minutes instead of ~104 minutes)
  - The function now correctly distinguishes between:
    - Variables that are only log-transformed: uses `exp(y) - 1`
    - Variables that are log+z transformed: uses `back_transform_log_z()`

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Improved plot labeling for clarity**:
  - Removed "outcome" label from y-axis in `margot_plot()` for cleaner appearance
  - Changed "Qini Curves" to "Uplift Curve" in plot titles across all qini plot functions
  - Changed "average policy effect" to "expected policy effect" in y-axis labels to better reflect the statistical nature of the estimates
  - Updated documentation and scale notes to use consistent "expected policy effect" terminology

# [2025-08-02] margot 1.0.228

### Major Improvements
- **Refactored outcome flipping to happen before computation**:
  - Moved flipping logic in `margot_causal_forest()` to preprocessing stage before the main loop
  - Flipped outcomes are now consistently stored in the data with "_r" suffix
  - Added `flip_info` metadata to output containing mapping and transformation details
  - Simplified data extraction in downstream functions - no more special handling needed
  - Ensures saved data is consistent with forest objects when `save_data = TRUE`

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed model name detection for flipped outcomes in heterogeneity functions**:
  - Added helper function `.map_model_names_with_flips()` to automatically detect and map flipped outcome names
  - Updated `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()` to handle model names with "_r" suffix (flipped outcomes)
  - Updated `margot_rate_cv()` to handle model names with "_r" suffix and simplified Y data extraction
  - Updated `margot_plot_rate_batch()` to handle flipped outcome names and changed default `compute_on_demand = TRUE`
  - Now correctly maps requested names like "t2_kessler_latent_anxiety_z" to "model_t2_kessler_latent_anxiety_z_r"
  - Fixes issue where functions couldn't find flipped models when using `model_names` parameter
  - Provides informative messages when mapping flipped outcomes

### Enhancements
- **Updated `margot_flip_forests()` to support flip methods**:
  - Added `flip_method` and `flip_scale_bounds` parameters for consistency with `margot_causal_forest()`
  - Now uses `margot_invert_measure()` for flipping, supporting both zscore and ordinal methods
  - Maintains backward compatibility with default zscore method

# [2025-08-02] margot 1.0.227

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `compute_conditional_means` to respect `compute_marginal_only` setting in `margot_causal_forest()`
- When `compute_marginal_only = TRUE`, conditional means computation is now skipped with defensive empty structure
- This ensures consistent behavior where marginal-only mode skips all heterogeneity-related computations

# [2025-08-02] margot 1.0.226

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed label mapping in `margot_plot()` to correctly handle reversed variables with `_r` suffix
- `transform_label()` now prioritizes exact matches in label_mapping before trying pattern matching
- Added automatic removal of `_r` suffix (for reversed variables) alongside `_z` suffix removal
- This prevents stray "_r" suffixes appearing on plot labels when using label_mapping

# [2025-08-02] margot 1.0.225

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `margot_plot()` to properly handle reversed variables (with `_r` suffix) when `original_df` is provided
- `back_transform_estimates()` now removes `_r` suffix before searching in original_df and skips silently if not found

### Breaking Changes
- **Renamed `compute_heterogeneity` to `compute_marginal_only` with inverted logic**:
  - `compute_marginal_only = TRUE` now means skip heterogeneity (was `compute_heterogeneity = FALSE`)
  - `compute_marginal_only = FALSE` (default) means compute full analysis
  - Clearer parameter name that explicitly states what is computed
  
- **Removed `qini_split` parameter**:
  - QINI evaluation now always uses honest evaluation (test set only)
  - Simplifies the interface and follows GRF best practices
  - Ensures QINI curves accurately reflect out-of-sample performance

### Major Improvements
- **Enhanced parameter validation**:
  - `compute_marginal_only = TRUE` requires `train_proportion = NULL` (enforced)
  - `compute_marginal_only = FALSE` requires valid `train_proportion` (enforced)
  - Clear error messages prevent conflicting parameter combinations
  
### Implementation Details
- Default behavior unchanged: `compute_marginal_only = FALSE, train_proportion = 0.5`
- Backward compatibility maintained through parameter detection in `margot_flip_forests()`
- Cleaner mental model: either marginal-only OR full-with-splits
- `margot_flip_forests()` now requires heterogeneity components and provides clear error when used with marginal-only results

### Benefits
- Prevents user confusion about parameter interactions
- Makes intentions explicit in function calls
- Simplifies understanding of what analyses will be performed
- Always uses honest QINI evaluation for accurate heterogeneity assessment

# [2025-08-01] margot 1.0.224

### Major Features
- **Added `compute_heterogeneity` parameter to `margot_causal_forest()`**:
  - Set to FALSE to skip QINI, RATE, and policy tree computations
  - Significantly faster when only average treatment effects are needed
  - Creates defensive empty data structures to maintain pipeline compatibility
  - Default TRUE maintains backward compatibility

### Improvements
- **Enhanced parameter inheritance in `margot_flip_forests()`**:
  - Now inherits all computation parameters from original results
  - Uses new `computation_params` structure when available
  - Falls back to old detection method for backward compatibility
  
- **Added computation tracking**:
  - New `computation_status` field tracks what was computed
  - New `computation_params` field stores all parameters for reproducibility
  - Enables future `margot_hetero()` function to compute missing heterogeneity metrics

### Implementation Details
- Empty data structures have `computed = FALSE` flag for downstream detection
- All existing pipelines continue to work unchanged
- Prepares architecture for separating effect estimation from heterogeneity evaluation

# [2025-08-01] margot 1.0.223

### Major Features
- **Added outcome flipping capability to `margot_causal_forest()`**:
  - New parameters: `flip_outcomes`, `flip_method`, and `flip_scale_bounds`
  - Supports two inversion methods:
    - `"zscore"`: Negates standardized z-scores while preserving relative distances
    - `"ordinal"`: Inverts values on ordinal scale using specified bounds (e.g., Likert scales)
  - Flipped outcomes automatically appended with "_r" suffix in results
  - Informative CLI messages report transformation details
  - Created `margot_invert_measure()` utility function for flexible score inversion
  - Comprehensive test suite for inversion functionality

### Implementation Details
- **Z-score method**: Simple negation (`-x`) for already standardized data. Warns if data appears unstandardized
- **Ordinal method**: Uses formula `(max + min) - x` to preserve distances while reversing order
- **Flexible specification**: Can flip all outcomes uniformly or specify per-outcome settings
- **NA handling**: Properly preserves missing values during transformation

# [2025-07-31] margot 1.0.222

### Improvements
- **Updated default spend_levels to c(0.1, 0.4)**:
  - Changed from single value 0.1 to c(0.1, 0.4) for better QINI analysis
  - Affected functions: margot_plot_qini(), margot_plot_qini_batch(), margot_interpret_heterogeneity(), 
    margot_policy(), margot_qini(), margot_qini_alternative(), margot_interpret_qini()
  - Provides visibility at both 10% and 40% treatment allocation levels

# [2025-07-31] margot 1.0.221

### Improvements
- **Ensured consistent train/test split usage across functions**:
  - `margot_interpret_heterogeneity`: Already uses test indices from qini_metadata via margot_rate()
  - `margot_qini_alternative`: Properly uses split_info$test_indices when available
  - `margot_flip_forests`: Now uses same train/test splits as original models for policy trees
  - `margot_policy_tree_stability`: Creates new splits by design for stability assessment

# [2025-07-31] margot 1.0.220

### Improvements
- **Enhanced `margot_flip_forests()` parameters**:
  - Added `seed` parameter for reproducible QINI generation (default 12345)
  - Now properly passes `train_proportion` and `use_train_test_split` to maintain consistency
  - Seed default matches `compute_qini_improved()` for consistent results
  - Fixed policy tree recalculation to use same train/test splits as original models

# [2025-07-31] margot 1.0.219

### Improvements
- **Enhanced QINI robustness**: Improved error handling and diagnostic output
  - Added tau_hat range and standard deviation reporting in verbose mode
  - Better handling of edge cases where CATE estimates have minimal variation
  - Clear diagnostic messages when QINI computation cannot proceed
  - Graceful fallback for empty CATE paths instead of failures

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed atomic vector access**: Resolved issue when accessing ate_evaluation_forest values
- **Fixed empty CATE path errors**: Now properly handles cases where maq returns empty paths
  - Common with homogeneous treatment effects (very low tau_hat variation)
  - Returns NULL with informative warning instead of crashing

# [2025-07-31] margot 1.0.218

### Major Improvements
- **Reimplemented QINI curves following GRF best practices**:
  - New `margot_qini_alternative()` function uses simplified GRF methodology
  - Single baseline method: `target.with.covariates = FALSE` (no-priority assignment)
  - Removed complex baseline options in favour of standard approach
  - Added `diff_gain_summaries` computation for backward compatibility
  - Created `margot_qini()` wrapper function for seamless integration
  - Default spend levels now 0.1 only (simplified from 0.1, 0.4)
  - Fixed "no gain data found for curve ate" warnings
  - Full compatibility with `margot_interpret_qini()` and `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`
  - Works seamlessly with `margot_flip_forests()` architecture
  - **Fixed DR scores consistency**: QINI curves now use doubly-robust scores from evaluation forest fitted on test data
    - Ensures QINI endpoints match ATE estimates when using same test data
    - Addresses discrepancy between QINI curve termination values and reported ATE
    - Following GRF advice: "use the same doubly-robust scores throughout"
  - **Improved robustness**: Added error handling for edge cases where baseline QINI computation fails
    - Gracefully handles empty paths or computation failures
    - Provides informative warnings when models cannot be processed
    - Continues processing remaining models instead of failing completely
  - **Unified QINI implementation**: All functions now use the improved GRF-standard approach
    - `margot_causal_forest()` automatically uses evaluation forest DR scores
    - `margot_flip_forests()` inherits improvements through `margot_causal_forest()`
    - `margot_policy()` uses improved QINI when regenerating curves
    - `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()` benefits through `margot_policy()`
    - Consistent QINI computation across the entire margot ecosystem

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed QINI implementation to use existing data structure**:
  - No longer requires `full_models` which was often empty
  - Works with standard `results` structure from `margot_causal_forest()`
  - Properly handles train/test splits when `use_train_test_split = TRUE`
- **Updated default baseline_method to "auto" in plotting functions**:
  - Changed `margot_plot_qini()` and `margot_plot_qini_batch()` default from "maq_no_covariates" to "auto"
  - Ensures consistency with `margot_plot_qini_simple()` and new QINI implementation
  - Both methods use the same GRF standard approach with `target.with.covariates = FALSE`

# [2025-07-30] margot 1.0.217

### New Features
- **Added optional train/test split for consistent out-of-sample evaluation**:
  - New `use_train_test_split` parameter in `margot_causal_forest()` (default FALSE for backward compatibility)
  - When TRUE, ALL reported results (ATE, E-values, combined_table) are computed on the TEST SET
  - Main causal forest still trained on all data (following GRF best practices for honest forests)
  - Policy trees and QINI use the same consistent train/test split
  - All-data results stored in `split_info` for reference when needed
  - Updated `margot_recompute_ate()` with `respect_train_test_split` parameter
  - Ensures consistent evaluation: when you choose train/test split, all results respect that decision

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed QINI seed bug**: QINI curves now use the user-provided seed parameter instead of hardcoded seed 42
  - Ensures reproducibility across all components
  - Default seed remains 12345 if not specified

# [2025-07-30] margot 1.0.216

### Improvements
- **Simplified interpretation output for log-transformed outcomes**:
  - Removed multiplicative percentage language from all interpretation functions
  - Confidence intervals now displayed in original scale units (dollars, minutes, etc.)
  - Cleaner format: "$463 average increase (95% CI: $137 to $883)" instead of "44% multiplicative increase (~$463 average increase; 95% CI: 13% to 84%)"
  - Updated both `margot_interpret_marginal()` and `margot_interpret_policy_tree()` functions
  - Makes output more consistent and easier to interpret

# [2025-07-30] margot 1.0.215

### Improvements
- **Updated `margot_interpret_marginal()` with correct back-transformation logic**:
  - Now properly handles log+z transformed variables with multiplicative interpretation
  - Displays percentage changes and absolute changes for log-transformed outcomes
  - Includes unit detection for monetary and time variables with appropriate formatting
  - Matches the sophisticated back-transformation logic from `margot_interpret_policy_tree()`
  - Example: "47% multiplicative increase (~$490 average increase; 95% CI: 32% to 64%)"
  - Ensures consistency across all margot interpretation functions

# [2025-07-30] margot 1.0.214

### Improvements
- **Added missing knitr dependency**: Moved knitr from Suggests to Imports to fix namespace dependency error

### Documentation Fixes
- **Fixed all documentation build warnings**: Claude code very smartly rewrote roxygen2 documentation for problematic functions to eliminate all warnings. Package now builds cleanly. 

# [2025-07-30] margot 1.0.213

### Major Changes
- **Simplified default spend levels to 0.1 (10%) throughout the package**:
  - Changed default `spend_levels` from `c(0.1, 0.4)` to `0.1` in all functions
  - Affected functions: `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`, `margot_qini()`, `margot_interpret_qini()`, 
    `margot_policy()`, `margot_plot_qini()`, `margot_plot_qini_batch()`, `margot_plot_qini_direct()`,
    `margot_qini_diagnostic()`, `margot_qini_cost_sensitivity()`, `margot_plot_qini_batch_cost_sensitivity()`,
    and `margot_batch_policy()` (deprecated)
  - Rationale: 10% spend captures early heterogeneity patterns effectively and simplifies interpretation
  - Reduces confusion from multiple spend levels with potentially contradictory results
  - Foundation for future transition to integrated differences over point estimates

### Work in Progress
- Investigating discrepancies between QINI plots and difference gain summaries
- Planning transition to integrated differences as primary metric (keeping point estimates for compatibility)

# [2025-07-30] margot 1.0.212

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed transformation lookup for flipped outcomes**:
  - Models created with `margot_flip_forests()` (with `_r` suffix) now correctly show original scale transformations
  - The fix removes the `_r` suffix when searching for original variables in `original_df`
  - Example: `model_t2_depression_z_r` now finds `t2_depression_z` data for transformation
  - Preserves the "(reduced)" prefix in labels as intended

# [2025-07-30] margot 1.0.211

### Major Changes
- **Corrected interpretation of log-transformed outcomes**:
  - Now uses multiplicative interpretation for log-transformed outcomes (standard econometric practice)
  - Treatment effects on log scale translate to multiplicative effects on original scale
  - Example: CATE of 0.14 with log SD of 2.74 gives 47% multiplicative increase
  - Updated display format: "47% multiplicative increase, ~$490 average increase"
  - Applies to both individual leaf CATEs and overall weighted average treatment effects

### Improvements
- **Enhanced numeric formatting in `format_minimal_decimals()`**:
  - Values < 1: displays 3 decimal places (e.g., 0.023)
  - Values 1-10: displays 2 decimal places (e.g., 3.45)
  - Values 10-100: displays 1 decimal place (e.g., 45.6)
  - Values ≥ 100: displays no decimal places (e.g., 234)
  - Prevents rounding to zero for small values and maintains appropriate precision
- **Improved reporting for log-transformed outcomes**:
  - Added `detect_variable_units()` to identify monetary variables and time-based variables
  - Log-transformed monetary outcomes now show percentage change and dollar values
  - Example: "13% increase, from $45 to $51" instead of "1.13x multiplicative effect"
  - Time variables (hours) automatically convert to minutes as per existing pattern
  - Overall performance section also shows percentage changes for log outcomes

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed transformation detection for log variables**:
  - Now correctly handles cases where original variable names contain `_log_` (e.g., `t2_log_charity_donate`)
  - Improved candidate variable search order to check for exact matches first

### Bug Fixes (continued)
- **Fixed underestimated dollar amounts for log-transformed outcomes**:
  - When `original_df` contains subset data, the code now detects unrealistically low values
  - For charity donations: if mean < $400, uses population estimate of $1,048 instead
  - For household income: if mean < $20k, uses population estimate of $60k instead
  - This fixes dollar amounts being off by a factor of ~11x
  - Example fix: Leaf CATEs now show ~$378-$553 instead of $33-$48 for charity donations

### Known Issues
- **Log transformation statistics from subset data**:
  - When `original_df` contains subset data, we use heuristics to correct population means
  - Better solution: store transformation parameters during initial data processing
  - Current approach works well for common variables (charity, income) but may need adjustment for others

# [2025-07-30] margot 1.0.210

### New Features
- **Display CATEs on original data scale in policy tree interpretations**:
  - Added `get_outcome_transformation_info()` helper function to detect and reverse transformations
  - Updated `margot_interpret_policy_tree()` and `margot_interpret_policy_batch()` to accept `original_df` parameter
  - When original data is provided, CATEs are shown in both standardized and original scales
  - For z-transformed outcomes: displays as "CATE: 0.1 (original scale: 0.5 units)"
  - For log-transformed outcomes: displays as "CATE: 0.1 (original scale: 1.2x multiplicative effect)"
  - Handles compound transformations (e.g., log then z-transform) correctly
  - Extended to overall performance metrics (weighted average treatment effect)
  - Added `format_minimal_decimals()` helper for cleaner numeric display (0 or 1 decimal place)

### Improvements
- **Enhanced count columns in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - Renamed `positive_count`/`negative_count` to `rate_positive_count`/`rate_negative_count` for clarity
  - Added `total_positive_count` and `total_negative_count` covering all 4 tests (differential_prediction_test, rate_autoc, rate_qini, qini_curve)
  - Added `is_excluded` indicator (1 if any negative RATE test, 0 otherwise)
  - Added `strict_inclusion_count` for positive RATE tests only when no negative RATE tests present
  - Maintained backwards compatibility by keeping original column names
- **Fixed concordance analysis**:
  - Now correctly uses `total_positive_count` to check for models positive in all 4 methods
  - Fixed discordance detection to consider all 4 tests rather than just RATE tests
- **Improved terminology precision**:
  - uses "statistically significant" throughout

### Future Plans (Phase 2)
- Plan to update `margot_causal_forest()`, `margot_flip_forest()`, and `margot_policy_tree_stability()` to store transformation metadata
- This will eliminate the need to pass `original_df` and make transformations more robust
- See PLANNING.md for detailed implementation plan

# [2025-07-29] margot 1.0.209

### Improvements
- **Enhanced label mapping in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - Improved default transformation to remove wave prefixes (e.g., "t2_")
  - Now correctly identifies reversed variables (ending in "_r" or "_z_r") and adds "(reduced)" prefix
  - Added special handling for common abbreviations (hlth --> health, bmi --> BMI, pwi --> PWI)
  - Results in cleaner outcome names like "Belonging" instead of "T2 Belong"
  - Reversed variables now show as "(reduced) Health Fatigue" instead of "T2 Hlth Fatigue z r"
- **Updated to use New Zealand English spelling throughout**:
  - Changed "analyze" --> "analyse", "analyzed" --> "analysed", "organize" --> "organise"
  - Consistent with project requirements
- **Improved recommendations format**:
  - Replaced bullet points with full sentences suitable for scientific reports
  - Now provides clear counts and proper grammar (singular/plural handling)
  - More professional presentation for academic contexts
- **Enhanced selection logic in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - QINI curve analysis now applied to all non-excluded models (not just selected ones)
  - Models can be selected based on either positive RATE tests OR positive QINI curves
  - Recognises that QINI curves can identify heterogeneity at specific budgets even when global tests are inconclusive
  - Extended report now indicates when models are selected based on QINI curve evidence
  - Decision flow updated to reflect this broader selection approach

# [2025-07-29] margot 1.0.208

### Breaking Changes
- **Simplified heterogeneity testing logic in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - Now uses clear 3-category system: SELECTED (positive RATE), EXCLUDED (negative RATE), UNCLEAR (no significant RATE)
  - Removed complex evidence_type categorization that caused contradictions
  - QINI curve analysis now only performed for SELECTED models
  - Calibration status reported for context but doesn't affect selection
- **Cross-validation now provides consistent estimates in `margot_rate_cv()`**:
  - Previously computed RATE estimates on full dataset after CV testing, causing inconsistency
  - Now both p-values and RATE estimates come from the CV procedure
  - RATE estimates are weighted averages across test folds
  - Confidence intervals are no longer reported for CV estimates as they don't align with the martingale-based hypothesis testing
  - This ensures selection criteria align with reported effect sizes

### Improvements
- **Better defaults in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - `include_extended_report = TRUE` by default (was already TRUE)
  - `use_cross_validation = TRUE` by default for robust confidence intervals
  - `cv_num_folds = 5` by default
  - RATE estimates now formatted with 3 decimal places and include 95% confidence intervals
- **Clearer decision flow and reporting**:
  - Added decision flow chart to extended report showing exact logic
  - Simplified recommendations format: "Use for targeting: X", "Avoid targeting: Y", "Evidence unclear: Z"
  - More intuitive interpretation sections aligned with the 3-category system

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed `margot_stability_diagnostics()` compatibility**:
  - Now works with new `stability_metrics` naming from `margot_policy_tree_stability()`
  - Handles both old `bootstrap_metrics` and new `stability_metrics` for backwards compatibility
  - Updated all references from "bootstrap" to "stability" in documentation and messages
- **Fixed incorrect "positive RATE" labeling in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - Function now correctly identifies and labels negative RATE values
  - Properly handles mixed positive/negative values (e.g., "positive RATE AUTOC, but negative RATE QINI")
  - Also fixed Qini difference labeling to handle negative values correctly
- **Fixed sprintf formatting error in `format_rate_with_ci()`**:
  - Now properly converts character estimates to numeric before formatting
  - Handles cases where conversion fails gracefully
- **Fixed missing confidence intervals in CV results**:
  - CV tables now preserve numeric confidence interval columns (`2.5%` and `97.5%`)
  - Extended report now shows confidence intervals when using cross-validation (the default)
- **Fixed misleading omnibus test language**: 
  - Extended reports no longer say "confirmed by omnibus tests" when the omnibus p-values are not significant
  - Now uses neutral language "Omnibus tests:" for non-significant results
- **Clarified decision flow language**:
  - Removed confusing "Avoid Y", "Use X", "Evidence unclear for Z" placeholders
  - Now clearly states actions in terms of targeting specific outcomes
  - Updated recommendations to use "Outcomes suitable for targeted treatment" instead of "Use for targeting"

### Removed
- **Removed `margot_compute_consensus_conditional_means()` function**:
  - No longer needed as `margot_policy_tree_stability()` now preserves all necessary data
  - Conditional means computation is handled automatically by existing functions

# [2025-07-29] margot 1.0.207

### Improvements
- **Enhanced `margot_policy_tree_stability()` data preservation**:
  - Now preserves outcome data, weights, and treatment assignments
  - Ensures all necessary data is available for downstream analysis
  - Maintains compatibility with plotting and interpretation functions
  
# [2025-07-29] margot 1.0.206

### Breaking Changes
- **Renamed bootstrap functions to stability functions**:
  - `margot_policy_tree_bootstrap()` --> `margot_policy_tree_stability()`
  - `margot_interpret_bootstrap()` --> `margot_interpret_stability()`
  - Class `"margot_bootstrap_policy_tree"` --> `"margot_stability_policy_tree"`
  - Parameter `n_bootstrap` --> `n_iterations`
  - Parameter `vary_type = "sample_only"` --> `vary_type = "bootstrap"`
  - Old function names are deprecated but still work with warnings
  
### New Features  
- **Added `margot_interpret_stability_batch()` function**:
  - Processes multiple models from stability analysis in one call
  - Returns named list of interpretations or combined text
  - Supports saving combined output to file
  - Includes theoretical context only for first model to avoid repetition

### Improvements
- **More accurate function naming**:
  - Default behavior performs train/test split variation, not bootstrap resampling
  - New names better reflect the stability analysis purpose
  - Documentation clarifies the difference between stability analysis and bootstrap
- **Better backwards compatibility**:
  - `margot_policy_tree_stability()` now accepts deprecated `n_bootstrap` parameter
  - Shows warning but still works to ease transition
  
# [2025-07-29] margot 1.0.205

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed scope error in `create_evidence_summary()`**:
  - Added `use_cross_validation` and `rate_results_list` parameters to function signature
  - Resolves error: "object 'use_cross_validation' not found"
  - These parameters are now properly passed from the main function to the evidence summary creation

# [2025-07-29] margot 1.0.204

### Improvements
- **More precise negative RATE detection in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - Now correctly uses CV table Status column to identify statistically significant negative RATE results
  - Only models with significant negative RATE (not just negative estimates) are flagged as "excluded_negative_rate"
  - Inconclusive results are no longer misclassified as negative
  - Enhanced recommendations to distinguish between:
    - "AVOID targeting X" (statistically significant negative RATE - harmful)
    - "Insufficient evidence for heterogeneity in Y" (no evidence found)
    - "Statistical heterogeneity detected but no actionable targeting evidence for Z" (omnibus positive but RATE not positive)

# [2025-07-29] margot 1.0.203

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed extended report generation error in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - CV rate tables use `model_id` column, not `outcome` column
  - Fixed column reference when looking up QINI and AUTOC results in extended reports
  - Resolves error: "Unknown or uninitialised column: `outcome`"
  
### Improvements
- **Enhanced recommendations in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - Now explains why models are excluded rather than just listing them
  - Separates models with negative RATE evidence (avoid due to reduced effectiveness) from models with no evidence
  - Provides clearer guidance: "Avoid targeting X due to negative RATE evidence" vs "No heterogeneity evidence found for Y"

# [2025-07-28] margot 1.0.202

### Breaking Changes
- **Revised heterogeneity evidence classification in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - Removed "mixed_evidence_caution" category for models with conflicting RATE results
  - Any model with negative RATE evidence (AUTOC or QINI) is now excluded entirely
  - Added new "exploratory_evidence" category for models with no negative RATE tests AND positive calibration or QINI curve
  - Changed return structure: replaced `cautiously_selected_model_ids/names` with `exploratory_model_ids/names`
  - `all_selected_model_ids` now combines selected + exploratory (not cautiously selected)
  - Added warning when models are excluded due to negative RATE evidence
  - New evidence_type values: "excluded_negative_rate", "exploratory_evidence" (replaces "mixed_evidence_caution")
  - This ensures more conservative selection by strictly excluding any model with verified negative heterogeneity

### Improvements
- **Changed default `parallel = FALSE` in `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**: Serial processing is currently faster than parallel for this function

# [2025-07-28] margot 1.0.201

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed label mapping in CV rate tables**:
  - `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()` now passes `label_mapping` parameter to `margot_rate_cv()`
  - CV rate tables now properly display transformed model names (e.g., "Personal Well-being Index" instead of "model_t2_pwi_z")
  - Fixed label transformation logic in `margot_rate_cv()` to use proper list indexing
  - Ensures consistency between evidence summary table and rate result tables
  
### Documentation
- **Updated citations to distinguish methodologies**:
  - Wager (2024) now correctly cited for sequential cross-validation methodology
  - Nie & Wager (2020) cited for general RATE (Rank Average Treatment Effect) approach
  - Fixed citation from incorrect "2021" to correct "2020" for Nie & Wager throughout codebase

# [2025-07-28] margot 1.0.200

  - Now defaults to the faster implementation for improved performance
  - Provides ~10x speed improvement for bootstrap analysis
  - Falls back gracefully to policytree if fastpolicytree is not installed
  - Particularly beneficial for bootstrap analysis with hundreds of iterations

- **Added `model_names` parameter to `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()`**:
  - Allows users to analyse only specific models rather than all models
  - Model names can be specified with or without "model_" prefix
  - Filters all computations (RATE, QINI, omnibus tests) to requested models only
  - Also filters pre-computed results when provided
  - Provides helpful warnings when requested models are not found
  - Consistent with other functions in the margot package

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()` RATE results export**:
  - Now properly exports raw RATE results from `margot_rate()` or `margot_rate_cv()` in `rate_results$raw_results`
  - This provides access to the full rate results including all statistics and confidence intervals
  - Previously, CV results from `margot_rate_cv()` were only accessible through the `cv_results` field
  - The raw results are now consistently available regardless of whether standard or CV method was used

# [2025-07-28] margot 1.0.199

### New Features
- **Extended fastpolicytree support to policy tree functions**:
  - Added `tree_method` parameter to `margot_recalculate_policy_trees()`
  - This function now uses the internal `.compute_policy_tree()` wrapper for consistent method handling
  - Users can benefit from 10x faster policy tree computation when recalculating trees with custom covariates

- **Added automatic labelling to diagnostic functions**:

  - Correlation plots now show human-readable labels instead of raw variable names
  - Cluster analysis output uses labeled variable names for better interpretability
  - Bootstrap interpretation now uses labeled variable and model names throughout

# [2025-07-28] margot 1.0.198

### Documentation
- **Enhanced `margot_policy_tree_bootstrap()` documentation**:
  - Added complete workflow example showing all diagnostic steps
  - Shows how to use correlation analysis with bootstrap results
  - Clarifies that correlation analysis needs original causal forest results
  - Added examples of all related diagnostic functions
  - Added @seealso section for related functions

# [2025-07-28] margot 1.0.197

- Updated metadata and CLI output to show which tree method is being used

# [2025-07-28] margot 1.0.195

### Improvements
- **Corrected interpretation guidance in bootstrap analysis**:
  - No longer suggests "simpler approaches" when trees show instability
  - Acknowledges that depth-2 trees typically outperform depth-1 trees despite higher instability
  - Emphasises trade-off between stability and predictive performance
  - Updated recommendations to focus on validation rather than simplification
  - Added note in theoretical background about performance vs stability trade-offs

# [2025-07-28] margot 1.0.194

### New Features

  - `margot_assess_variable_correlation()`: Analyses correlations among covariates to identify multicollinearity
  - `margot_identify_variable_clusters()`: Groups correlated variables into clusters
  - `margot_stability_diagnostics()`: Comprehensive stability assessment combining bootstrap and correlation analyses
  - These functions help explain why policy trees show instability when variables are correlated

### Improvements

  - Frames variable selection variability in context of correlated predictors
  - Includes theoretical context about decision tree sensitivity (can be disabled)
  - More nuanced interpretation of stability patterns
  - Emphasises that correlated variables may capture similar information
  - Added `include_theory` parameter to control theoretical context inclusion

# [2025-07-28] margot 1.0.193

### Breaking Changes
- **Changed default bootstrap approach in `margot_policy_tree_bootstrap()`**:
  - Default `vary_type` is now "split_only" instead of "both"
  - By default, varies random seeds to create different train/test splits
  - No longer performs bootstrap resampling by default
  - This change reflects that decision trees are highly sensitive to data perturbations
  - Bootstrap resampling can still be enabled with `vary_type = "sample_only"` or `vary_type = "both"`

### Improvements

## Improved
- `margot_causal_forest()` now passes doubly robust scores to policy decision trees. We now compute policy trees using doubly robust (DR) scores from \texttt{grf::get_scores()} rather than the previous IPW-based approach. DR scores combine outcome and propensity estimates, yielding improved statistical power and more efficient estimation of treatment effects. This change is backward compatible -- no modifications to user code are required -- and a note is printed during execution indicating that DR scores are used.

# [2025-03-21] margot 0.3.2.8

# [2025-03-17] margot 0.3.1.8

## New
- `margot_rate()` produce a table for RATE estimates from batched processed causal forests.
- `margot_flip_forests()` when interpreting the effect as *benefitial* we may need to invert the outcomes. This function does this on already processed models.
- `margot_interpret_rate()` provides automated reporting of rate outputs, allowing users to specify whether AUTOC or QINI was targeted. 

## Improved
- `margot_causal_forest()` - now also computes RATE targeting the QINI when this is selected. 

# [2025-03-15] margot 0.3.1.7

## Improved

# [2025-03-12] margot 0.3.1.3

## Improved
- `margot_censor()`: censoring is conditional on both the condition and the wave: if $\texttt{censor_final_wave = FALSE}$ then rows in the final wave (determined as $\texttt{max(dt[[wave_var]])}$) are preserved (default behaviour). This allows for estimating a per-protocal effect where changing a censoring condition is part of the causal effect of the intervention for the population at baseline.

# [2025-03-05] margot 0.3.1.2

## New
 - `margot_transition_table()` replaces `transition_table()` and `create_transition_matrix()` and will print out state change for multiple waves. Useful for longitudinal modified treatment policies. (Old functions soft deprecated as helper functions.)

# [2025-02-06] margot 0.3.1.1

## Improved
- `margot_plot` and `margot_interpret_marginal` now all reporting of all coefficients if E-value is above 1 (instead of 1.1, the default threshold). 

- `margot_censor` now deletes all values of a variable if the censoring indicator is set to 1 (or year_measured == 0), instead of merely changing the indicator. This can be helpful downstream of this function when handling dyadic data.

# [2025-02-05] margot 0.3.1.0

## Improved

- `margot_process_longitudinal_data_wider` can now handle dyadic data, so that if an agent's partner is censored, then the agent is also censored.

# [2025-01-18] margot 0.3.0.9

## New
- `margot_combine_results` Takes multiple results tables from `margot_plot` objects and combines them into a single
formatted table using `kableExtra`, with optional group headers for each section.

## Improved
-`margot_plot` has option `standardize_label` which when to display Standardised, Standardized, or to remove it altogether ("none").
  - For Risk Ratios (type = "RR"), the code always omits that word and shows the label as "Effect (Risk Ratio Scale)".
	- For Risk Differences (type = "RD"), if standardize_label = "NZ" you get "Standardised Effect (Difference Scale)"; if standardize_label = "US" you get "Standardized Effect (Difference Scale)"; and if standardize_label = "none", you get "Effect (Difference Scale)".

# [2025-01-17] margot 0.3.0.8

## Improved
- `margot_plot` has a new parameter `include_coefficients` which if set to TRUE will remove the coefficients from a graph. This makes it easier to view the results. 
-  minor fix to `margot_save_png` so that it defaults to the output folder set by `push_mods`

# [2024-12-29] margot 0.3.0.7

# [2024-12-29] margot 0.3.0.6

## Improved
`margot_impute_carry_forward()` is more efficient. Can carry forward more than one-wave if a future observation is made and 'require_one_observed' is set to "TRUE".

# [2025-09-18] margot 1.0.236

### New
- Added `margot_report_consensus_policy_value()` to report how much better a consensus policy performs than (a) treat-all (ATE baseline) and (b) treat-none (universal control), with 95% CIs from bootstrap SEs.
- Added `margot_table_consensus_policy_value()` to produce a compact, manuscript-ready table for consensus policy values per outcome and depth, for both contrasts.

### Improvements
- `margot_policy_tree_stability()` now persists consensus splits in the stability metrics to support threshold-aware interpretation and reporting.
- Depth-2 consensus now includes `threshold_sd` for both first-level nodes.
- `margot_interpret_stability()` and `margot_interpret_stability_batch()` can optionally include simple CIs for selection frequencies and thresholds in technical output (`include_ci = TRUE`).
- `summary.margot_stability_policy_tree()` displays a quick consensus policy value summary vs treat-all and control-all (light bootstrap, R=199).

### Notes
- All changes are backward compatible. New parameters default to previous behavior.
# [2025-09-19] margot 1.0.240 - 1.0.241
 
# [2025-09-25] margot 1.0.242

### New
- `margot_policy_workflow()`: one-call policy workflow that orchestrates depth selection (`margot_policy_summary_compare_depths()`), mixed-depth summary reporting (`margot_policy_summary_report()`), and optional interpretations (`margot_interpret_policy_batch()`). Adds `brief_include_group` to control whether the policy brief includes the Group column.
- Shared text helper `margot_policy_value_explainer()` for consistent definitions of policy value vs control-all/treat-all, coverage, uplift, and the identity PV(control-all) = Coverage × Uplift_Treated.

### Improvements
- `margot_policy_summary_compare_depths()` adds `min_gain_for_depth_switch` (default 0.005) to prefer depth-1 unless depth-2 yields a material out-of-sample gain.
- `margot_policy_summary_report()` now supports `audience = c("policy","research")` to drive policy-facing wording and includes `return_unit_masks` to return per-model evaluation masks (including `not_excluded_ids`) for downstream plotting and drill-downs. The compact policy brief now includes `Depth`, and an issue dropping depth-1 rows from the summary table when precomputed reports were supplied was fixed.
- `margot_interpret_policy_batch()` gains `policy_value_source = c("compute","use_coherent")` and `coherent_values` so interpretations can reuse PV rows from the summary report instead of recomputing CIs.

### Documentation
- Added `README.qmd` with quick-start usage of the new policy workflow and a summary of 1.0.242 changes.

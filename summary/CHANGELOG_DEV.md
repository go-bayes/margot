# CHANGELOG_DEV.md

## margot 1.0.211 (2025-07-30)

### Major Changes

- **Corrected interpretation of log-transformed outcomes in policy trees**:
  - Implemented multiplicative interpretation for log-transformed outcomes (standard econometric practice)
  - Treatment effects on log scale now correctly translate to multiplicative effects on original scale
  - Updated calculation: delta_log = treatment_effect * log_sd, ratio = exp(delta_log), pct_change = (ratio - 1) * 100
  - Changed display format from "37% increase, from $32.7 to $44.8" to "47% multiplicative increase, ~$490 average increase"
  - Applied to both individual leaf CATEs and overall weighted average treatment effects
  - Added detection and correction for unrealistic population means from subset data
  - For charity donations: corrects mean from ~$92 to ~$1,048 when subset data is detected
  - This fixes dollar amounts being underestimated by factor of ~11x
  - Example: Leaf CATEs now correctly show ~$378-$553 instead of $33-$48

## margot 1.0.182 (2025-07-28)

### New Features

- **New margot_policy_tree() function**:
  - Provides direct computation of policy trees without re-running causal forests
  - Supports flexible covariate selection:
    - Exclude patterns (e.g., "_log" to remove log-transformed variables)
    - Custom covariate sets
    - Multiple modes: original, custom, add, all
  - User-configurable train_proportion parameter (default 0.5)
  - Depth selection: compute depth-1, depth-2, or both
  - Full compatibility with downstream functions:
    - margot_policy()
    - margot_plot_policy_tree()
    - margot_plot_policy_combo()
    - margot_interpret_policy_tree()
  - Structured output matching margot_causal_forest() format
  - Comprehensive metadata tracking for reproducibility
  - Output works directly with existing functions: margot_plot_policy_tree(), 
    margot_interpret_policy_tree(), and margot_plot_policy_combo()
  - No need for special wrapper functions - the design ensures full compatibility

### Improvements

- **Updated policy tree estimation defaults**:
  - Changed default train_proportion from 0.7 to 0.5 in margot_causal_forest(), 
    margot_flip_forests(), and margot_policy_tree()
  - Added seed parameter to margot_causal_forest() (default 12345) for reproducible 
    train/test splits
  - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Both depth-1 and depth-2 policy trees now use only top_n_vars
  - This ensures consistency between tree depths and reduces overfitting risk
  - Seeds are model-specific to maintain independence across outcomes

## margot 1.0.181 (2025-07-28)

### Improvements

- **Enhanced margot_rate_cv() result interpretation**:
  - Added warnings for models showing negative heterogeneity (negative t-statistics)
  - Only displays alpha level when an adjustment method is used (bonferroni)
  - Provides clearer messaging about statistical significance and practical implications
  - Helps users identify models where heterogeneity may be in opposite direction

## margot 1.0.141 (2025-07-25)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed scale parameter error in margot_interpret_qini**:
  - Added missing scale parameter to margot_interpret_qini_binary function
  - Fixed parameter passing from margot_interpret_qini to margot_interpret_qini_binary
  - Added validation to ensure scale is always a length-1 vector
  - Resolves "EXPR must be a length 1 vector" error in switch statement

- **Added seed and sample.weights support to all maq calls**:
  - Updated `compute_qini_curves_binary()` to accept and pass weights and seed parameters
  - Updated `margot_generate_qini_data()` to accept and pass seed parameter
  - Updated `margot_recompute_qini_ipw()` and `margot_recompute_qini_aipw()` to pass seed
  - All maq::maq() calls now include seed = 42 for reproducibility
  - sample.weights parameter properly passed when weights are available
  - Ensures reproducible QINI curves and correct handling of weighted data

### QINI Scale Transformations

- **Added scale parameter to QINI plot functions**:
  - New `scale` parameter in `margot_plot_qini()` and `margot_plot_qini_batch()` with options:
    - "average" (default): Shows average policy effects per unit (maq default implementation)
    - "cumulative": Shows traditional cumulative gains (multiply by proportion)
    - "population": Shows total population impact (multiply by proportion and n_units)
  - Transforms both main curves and confidence intervals appropriately
  - Y-axis labels update automatically based on selected scale
  - Documentation explains difference between maq's average gains and traditional QINI cumulative gains

- **Created helper functions for scale interpretation**:
  - `margot_qini_scale_note()`: Generates explanatory text for what each scale represents
  - `margot_qini_scale_subtitle()`: Creates brief descriptions for plot subtitles
  - Helps users understand the meaning of different scale options

- **Updated margot_interpret_qini for scale awareness**:
  - Added `scale` parameter to affect interpretation text

  - Adds explanatory notes when using non-default scales
  - Ensures consistency between plots and interpretations

## margot 1.0.140 (2025-07-24)

### QINI Curve Improvements

- **Consistent baseline method across package**: 
  - Updated `margot_causal_forest()` to use "maq_no_covariates" as default baseline method
  - Previously used constant rewards ("maq_constant"), now matches visualization functions
  - Includes automatic fallback to constant rewards if maq_no_covariates fails
  - This makes the theoretically preferred method consistent throughout the package

- **Fixed QINI regeneration for flipped models**: Resolved issue where flipped models (with _r suffix) failed to regenerate QINI curves when baseline_method was changed
  - Removed conditional check that prevented regeneration when mc_result$data was NULL
  - Added fallback to existing QINI data when regeneration fails
  - Enhanced debugging for forest object retrieval
  
- **Added customizable QINI plot colors**: 
  - New parameters `cate_color` (default: gold #d8a739) and `ate_color` (default: dark gray #4d4d4d)
  - Available in both `margot_plot_qini()` and `margot_plot_qini_batch()`
  - Improves visual distinction between CATE-based targeting and no-priority assignment
  
- **Ensured QINI consistency with metadata storage**:
  - Store QINI generation metadata including test indices, baseline method, and data split info
  - `margot_summary_cate_difference_gain()` now uses stored metadata to ensure average gains use same data subset as original QINI curves
  - Added informative CLI messages throughout for transparency
  - Fixed baseline_method metadata to correctly reflect "maq_constant" for compute_qini_curves_binary
  
- **Fixed breaking change in QINI regeneration**: 
  - Added check to verify data availability before attempting QINI regeneration

- **Updated default spend levels across package**:
  - Changed default spend_levels from c(0.2, 0.5) to c(0.1, 0.4) in all functions
  - Affected functions: margot_plot_qini, margot_plot_qini_batch, margot_interpret_qini, 
    margot_interpret_heterogeneity, margot_policy, margot_qini, margot_qini_diagnostic, margot_batch_policy
  - Better reflects typical use cases where 10% and 40% spend levels are more informative than 20% and 50%

### Heterogeneity Interpretation Enhancements

- **Added cautiously selected models category**: `margot_interpret_heterogeneity()` now returns additional outputs:
  - `cautiously_selected_model_ids` and `cautiously_selected_model_names` for models with mixed evidence
  - `all_selected_model_ids` and `all_selected_model_names` combine both selected and cautiously selected models
  - These are models that show positive evidence in some tests but negative in others
  - Helps users identify models that may benefit from targeting but require careful validation
  - Example: models showing QINI curve benefits but negative RATE tests
  - When data is not available (e.g., save_data = FALSE), falls back to existing QINI curves with warning
  - Prevents errors when trying to change baseline_method without available data
  - Users now get clear warnings instead of cryptic errors

### QINI Baseline Method Consistency

- **Added baseline_method tracking**: `margot_policy()` and `margot_qini()` now store the baseline method used
  - Enables detection of mismatches between plots and interpretation summaries
  - Stored in output structure for each model

- **Enhanced margot_interpret_qini()**: Added baseline_method parameter
  - Accepts NULL (default) to use stored baseline method
  - Can specify alternative baseline methods: "maq_no_covariates", "auto", "simple", "maq_only", "none"
  - Warns when requested baseline method differs from stored method
  - Future: will support regeneration of summaries with different baseline methods

- **Fixed margot_qini() regeneration**: Now properly regenerates QINI curves when baseline method changes
  - Detects when stored baseline method differs from requested method
  - Forces regeneration and updates the original model objects
  - Ensures diff_gain_summaries use the new baseline method
  - Prevents mismatch between QINI plots and interpretation tables

## margot 1.0.130 (2025-07-24)

### New Features
- **margot_qini()**: New standalone function for generating QINI curves and difference gain summaries
  - Takes causal forest results as input (like margot_rate does)
  - Generates QINI curves using margot_generate_qini_data()
  - Computes difference gain summaries at specified spend levels
  - Returns structured output suitable for margot_interpret_qini()
  - Supports baseline_method parameter for flexibility
  - Includes label_mapping and formatting options
  - Provides direct access to QINI analysis without full policy analysis

- **margot_interpret_rate()**: Moved from _temp folder to main R package
  - Now properly exported and documented
  - Interprets RATE estimates from margot_rate()
  - Handles both single method (AUTOC or QINI) and comparison of both
  - Provides markdown-formatted summaries
  - Includes margot_interpret_rate_comparison() for comparing AUTOC vs QINI

### Improvements
- **margot_interpret_qini()**: Updated to accept output from both margot_policy() and margot_qini()
  - Added documentation about dual compatibility
  - No breaking changes to existing functionality

- **Consistent API design**:
  - margot_rate() → margot_interpret_rate() for RATE analysis
  - margot_qini() → margot_interpret_qini() for QINI analysis  
  - Both follow the same pattern for generation and interpretation

### Documentation
- Updated _pkgdown.yml to include margot_qini in "Interpret and Report Results" section
- All new functions properly documented with examples

### Default Changes
- Changed default baseline_method from "auto" to "maq_no_covariates" in all QINI functions:
  - margot_generate_qini_data()
  - margot_qini()
  - margot_plot_qini()
  - margot_plot_qini_batch()
  - margot_policy()
- This makes the default behavior more theoretically sound and predictable
- **Important**: "maq_no_covariates" now automatically falls back to simple baseline if maq fails
  - Provides robustness while maintaining theoretical preference
  - Clear warning messages when fallback occurs
  - Users always get a baseline curve with the default setting

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed outcome data retrieval for flipped models (those with _r suffix)
  - margot_plot_qini(), margot_qini(), and margot_policy() now prioritize getting data from forest objects for flipped models
  - Flipped models use the same outcome data as stored in their GRF forest objects (Y.orig)
  - This ensures QINI curves are computed with the correct data that was used to train the model
  - Resolves "Cannot find outcome data" errors for reversed/flipped models
  - **Note on flipped model data**: When models are created via margot_flip_forests(), the outcome
    is negated ONCE during model creation. The forest's Y.orig contains the already-negated values.
    QINI calculations correctly use this pre-negated data without additional flipping, ensuring
    consistency between model training and QINI curve generation.
  - **Fixed QINI regeneration for flipped models**: Previously, QINI regeneration with different baseline
    methods would fail for flipped models when mc_result$data was NULL. Now allows regeneration by
    accessing outcome data from forest objects (Y.orig) even when the main data object is unavailable.
  - **Improved margot_flip_forests() data handling**: Now properly merges flipped outcome data into the
    main data object, and removes original outcome data when remove_original=TRUE. This ensures
    downstream functions can find flipped outcome data in the expected locations.
  - **Enhanced QINI regeneration with better debugging and fallback**:
    - Added detailed debugging messages when forest objects can't be found for flipped models
    - Checks multiple locations for forest objects (model_result$model, model_result$full_model, mc_result$full_models)
    - Implements graceful fallback to existing QINI data when regeneration fails
    - Preserves QINI metadata (test indices, sample sizes) to ensure consistent regeneration
    - Uses stored test indices when regenerating to match original sample size
  - **Customizable QINI plot colors**: Added `cate_color` and `ate_color` parameters to margot_plot_qini() 
    and margot_plot_qini_batch() for full color customization. New defaults: gold (#d8a739) for CATE 
    (targeted treatment) and dark gray (#4d4d4d) for ATE (no-priority assignment)

  - More robust than relying on maq output for constant rewards
  - Aligns with maq conceptual approach while being more predictable
- **margot_plot_qini() enhancements**:
  - Changed CATE curve color from blue (#4f88c6) to green (#009E73) to avoid "control" association
  - Added ylim parameter for manual y-axis control (defaults to automatic scaling)
  - ylim parameter also added to margot_plot_qini_batch() for consistency

  - This approach is more robust and handles edge cases better
  - Follows maq's mathematical approach for ATE baselines (straight line)
  - Future: can remove QINI generation from margot_causal_forest() entirely
- **Robust baseline methods for QINI curves**:
  - Created margot_qini_simple_baseline() function that generates baseline curves that cannot fail
  - Implemented hybrid approach in margot_generate_qini_data() with options:
    - "auto" (default): Try maq with target.with.covariates = FALSE, fall back to simple baseline
    - "simple": Always use simple baseline (straight line from (0,0) to (1, mean(tau_hat)))
    - "maq_no_covariates": Use maq with target.with.covariates = FALSE (may fail)
    - "maq_only": Use standard maq with constant rewards (may fail)
    - "none": No baseline curve
  - Simple baseline implements average_gain() method for compatibility with diff_gain_summaries
  - Updated margot_summary_cate_difference_gain() to handle both maq and simple baseline objects
  - Added integrated_difference_simple() function for computing differences with simple baselines
  - Enhanced data extraction to find Y and W data in grf forest objects when mc_result$data is NULL
  - Baseline method parameter added to margot_plot_qini(), margot_plot_qini_batch(), and margot_policy()
  - Simple baseline represents expected gain under random allocation: gain(B) = B * E[tau]
  - Smart fallback logic in margot_plot_qini(): when data regeneration fails but simple baseline is requested,
    adds baseline to existing QINI data by extracting ATE from multiple sources
  - Improved regeneration logic: only regenerates when data is available or when changing baseline types
  - Better error messages showing available fields when baseline generation fails

### Breaking Changes
- **Removed save_plot parameters**: 
  - Removed save_plot and related parameters (dpi, width, height, output_dir) from:
    - margot_plot_qini_batch()
    - margot_policy()
    - margot_plot_rate_batch()
  - Users should save plots manually using ggplot2::ggsave() if needed
  - Simplifies functions and reduces maintenance burden

  - Added `grf_defaults` parameter to allow users to specify GRF model parameters
  - When NULL (default), automatically extracts parameters from original fitted models
  - Ensures consistency between original and flipped models
  - Extracts common parameters: num.trees, honesty, honesty.fraction, alpha, min.node.size, mtry, etc.

  - Increased color opacity (0.85) and line weights for clearer, more vibrant visualizations

### Enhanced Qini Analysis Functions
- **margot_interpret_qini()** major improvements:

  - Added `include_intro` parameter to control explanatory text about CATE and Qini curves
  - New `concise_summary` output provides brief summary grouping outcomes by benefit/harm/no effect
  - Enhanced explanatory text describes how Qini curves work for beneficial vs detrimental exposures
  - Dynamic handling of any number of spend levels
  - Automatic detection of available spend levels with warnings when requested levels don't exist
  - Function will use available spend levels if requested ones are not found in the data

  - Labels positioned to avoid overlap when multiple spend levels are shown

### API Consistency Improvements
- Renamed `spend` parameter to `spend_levels` in both `margot_policy()` and `margot_batch_policy()`
  - This creates consistency with `margot_interpret_qini()` which uses `spend_levels`
  - Makes the API more intuitive and predictable
  - Backward compatibility note: users need to update their code to use `spend_levels` instead of `spend`

### Bug Fixes (Additional)
- Fixed `margot_policy()` and `margot_batch_policy()` to pass `spend_levels` to `margot_plot_qini()`
  - Previously, Qini plots always showed vertical lines at 20% and 50% regardless of the spend_levels parameter
  - Now the vertical lines in Qini plots correctly match the spend levels used for diff_gain_summaries
- Fixed `margot_plot_qini()` to properly use custom label mappings in plot titles
  - Now tries exact match first before falling back to transform_label pattern matching
  - Handles both "model_outcome" and "outcome" key formats in label_mapping

### Minor Improvements
- Updated `margot_reversed_labels()` to use "(reduced)" instead of "(reversed)" suffix
  - Makes interpretation clearer that the outcome direction has been reduced/flipped
  - Affects all flipped outcome labels throughout the package
- Enhanced `margot_interpret_rate_comparison()` output with richer information
  - Now includes RATE estimates and 95% CIs for all reported outcomes
  - Added section for negative RATE estimates with explicit caution against CATE prioritisation
  - Added summary of unreliable outcomes where neither method found significant heterogeneity
  - More informative comparison text suitable for academic reporting
  - Reformatted output to use flowing paragraph text instead of bullets and choppy sentences
  - All information now presented as cohesive paragraphs suitable for direct inclusion in academic papers

### Policy Tree Interpretation Updates (2025-07-20)
- Modified `margot_interpret_policy_batch()` output formatting:
  - Removed "Policy tree analysis results:" line after the heading
  - Now displays clean output with just the heading followed by findings
- Enhanced `margot_interpret_policy_tree()` clarity:
  - Added "at the end of study" to all Findings headings for temporal clarity
  - Added "baseline" prefix to all variable names in tree splits and leaf descriptions
  - This disambiguation makes it clear that splits are based on baseline characteristics, not outcomes
- Simplified CATE reporting in leaf descriptions:
  - Removed confusing interpretations about treatment "improving" or "worsening" outcomes
  - Now simply states the CATE value without subjective interpretation
  - More appropriate for standardized outcomes where negative values are common
  - Overall policy advice remains in the summary section

### Policy Tree Plotting Updates (2025-07-20)
- Enhanced `margot_plot_policy_tree()` to clarify baseline variables:
  - Added "(baseline)" to axis labels on all policy tree plots
  - Added "(baseline)" to plot titles and subtitles
  - Updated both depth-1 and depth-2 plots for consistency
- Enhanced `margot_plot_decision_tree()` to clarify temporal context:
  - Now appends "Outcome" to outcome labels in titles
  - Example: "Neuroticism" now displays as "Neuroticism Outcome"
- Updated `transform_var_name()` helper function:
  - Now removes "_l" suffix from variable names
  - Capitalizes NZSEI and NZDEP acronyms properly
  - Example: "t0_nzsei_13_l" now displays as "NZSEI 13"

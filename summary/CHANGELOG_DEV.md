# CHANGELOG_DEV.md

## margot 1.0.80 (2025-07-19)

### New Features
- **Conditional Means Support**: Added experimental support for conditional means computation via `policytree::conditional_means()`
  - New parameter `compute_conditional_means` in `margot_causal_forest()` (default TRUE)
  - Conditional means are computed for each model and stored in results
  - Works with both regular and parallel versions of causal forest functions
  - Provides expected outcomes under each treatment arm for enhanced interpretability

### Technical Details
- Conditional means computation requires the `policytree` package
- Computation is wrapped in error handling to ensure graceful degradation
- The feature is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting `compute_conditional_means = FALSE`

### Policy Tree Interpretation Enhancements
- Enhanced `margot_interpret_policy_tree()` with conditional means interpretation
  - New `include_conditional_means` parameter (default TRUE)
  - Shows expected outcomes under each treatment within policy tree leaves
  - Computes average treatment effects within each leaf
  - Provides N units in each leaf
  - Works seamlessly with `margot_interpret_policy_batch()`
  - Enhanced depth-2 tree interpretation to show all 4 leaves with conditional means
  - Added percentage of units assigned to recommended action in each leaf
  - Maintains overall test set allocation summary
  - Added leaf summary showing size and percentage of each leaf
  - Added percentages to overall allocation summary
  - Shows total test set size for clarity
- Made output more user-friendly and quarto-compatible:
  - Added interpretation guide with callout tips
  - Uses markdown headers (###, ####) for better structure
  - Added effect size interpretations (small/moderate/large)
  - Added outcome interpretations (below/near/above average)
  - Uses formatted treatment effects with + sign for clarity
  - Added key takeaway summary in callout note
  - Ready to drop directly into quarto documents
- Improved output clarity and flexibility:
  - Changed default output to clear, simple language (science should be clear!)
  - Added `use_math_notation` parameter (default FALSE) for optional mathematical notation
  - Added `output_format` parameter with "bullet" (default) and "prose" options
  - Prose format creates flowing narrative text suitable for direct inclusion in papers
  - Removed uncertainty quantification disclaimer (just report point estimates)
  - Enhanced leaf output with sample sizes and percentages
  - Added interpretation arrows showing effect direction
  - Suitable for both academic papers and policy documents

### Refactoring Completed
- `margot_flip_forests()` completely rewritten to create new models with "_r" suffix
  - No longer modifies models in place
  - Properly recomputes all statistics (ATE, RATE, E-values)
  - Handles conditional means by swapping columns for binary treatment
  - Automatically rebuilds combined_table
  - Fixed QINI recalculation to properly access outcome data and treatment assignment
  - Added multiple fallback strategies to find outcome data with different key formats
  - Now copies original QINI data as fallback when recalculation fails

### New Functions Added
- Created `margot_recalculate_policy_trees()` - exported function for customizing policy tree covariates
  - Supports four covariate modes: "original", "custom", "add", "all"
  - Allows exclusion of covariates via regex patterns
  - Handles automatic expansion for depth-2 trees when needed
  - Includes parallel processing support
  - Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Function Updates
- Updated `margot_reversed_labels()` to handle new "_r" suffix convention
  - New parameter `use_r_suffix` (default TRUE) creates entries with "_r" suffix
  - Old behavior available by setting `use_r_suffix = FALSE`
  - New parameter `remove_original` to optionally remove non-flipped entries
  - Maintains backward compatibility

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed "subscript out of bounds" error in depth-2 policy tree interpretation
  - Added checks for valid indices before subsetting
  - Handles cases where no units fall in left or right branches
- Fixed "non-character argument" error in `margot_interpret_policy_batch`
  - Added validation for NULL interpretations
  - Gracefully handles cases where all interpretations fail
- Added error handling around conditional means computation
  - Prevents entire interpretation from failing if conditional means error
- Fixed parameter naming error in `margot_flip_forests_parallel`
  - Changed `n_cores_policy` to `n_cores` to match `margot_recalculate_policy_trees` signature
- Fixed propensity plot title in `margot_assess_overlap`
  - Now correctly shows exposure name instead of undefined outcome_name

### Cleanup Completed
- Removed `margot_flip_forests_dev()` and its artifacts since functionality exists in `margot_recalculate_policy_trees()`

### New Diagnostic Function: margot_assess_overlap
- Added `margot_assess_overlap()` function for evaluating propensity score overlap
  - Analyzes common support regions for treatment validity
  - Provides comprehensive diagnostics for causal estimate reliability
  - Generates propensity score distribution plots by treatment group
  - Includes covariate balance tables within propensity score strata
  - Reports test calibration p-values from grf
  - Provides trimming summaries for poor overlap regions
  - Added `exposure_name` parameter to specify the treatment variable
  - Added `label_mapping` parameter for custom exposure labels
  - **Refactored to focus on exposure overlap rather than outcome overlap**
  - Now correctly calculates overlap statistics once for the exposure variable
  - Fixed conceptual issue where overlap was incorrectly assessed per outcome
  - Now uses `transform_label` helper for automatic label formatting
  - Applies label transformation to both exposure and outcome names when no custom mapping provided
  - Added `text_summary` return value with prose description suitable for dropping into documents
  - Text summary can be used with `cat(overlap_results$text_summary)` for easy report inclusion
  - Added `theme` parameter to allow customization of ggplot2 theme (default: "classic")
  - Updated propensity plot colors to use package-consistent colors: treatment (#d8a739) and control (#4f88c6)
  - Enhanced text summary with interpretation of what overlap means in causal inference context
  - Increased color opacity (0.85) and line weights for clearer, more vibrant visualizations

### Enhanced Qini Analysis Functions
- **margot_interpret_qini()** major improvements:
  - Added `spend_levels` parameter to analyze custom spend levels (default: c(0.2, 0.5))
  - Added `include_intro` parameter to control explanatory text about CATE and Qini curves
  - New `concise_summary` output provides brief summary grouping outcomes by benefit/harm/no effect
  - Enhanced explanatory text describes how Qini curves work for beneficial vs detrimental exposures
  - Dynamic handling of any number of spend levels
  - Automatic detection of available spend levels with warnings when requested levels don't exist
  - Function will use available spend levels if requested ones are not found in the data
  - Backward compatible with existing code

- **margot_plot_qini()** enhanced visualization:
  - Added vertical dashed lines at spend levels (customizable via `show_spend_lines`, `spend_line_color`, `spend_line_alpha`)
  - Replaced multiple label parameters with single `label_mapping` using `transform_label` helper
  - Added `theme` parameter for ggplot2 theme selection (matches margot_assess_overlap)
  - Spend levels shown in plot match those analyzed in margot_interpret_qini
  - Cleaner function signature with fewer parameters
  - Added text annotations to label spend level lines (e.g., "20% spend", "50% spend")
  - Labels positioned to avoid overlap when multiple spend levels are shown

### API Consistency Improvements
- Renamed `spend` parameter to `spend_levels` in both `margot_policy()` and `margot_batch_policy()`
  - This creates consistency with `margot_interpret_qini()` which uses `spend_levels`
  - Makes the API more intuitive and predictable
  - Backward compatibility note: users need to update their code to use `spend_levels` instead of `spend`

### Bug Fixes (Additional)
- Fixed `margot_policy()` and `margot_batch_policy()` to pass `spend_levels` to `margot_plot_qini()`
  - Previously, Qini plots always showed vertical lines at 20% and 50% regardless of the spend_levels parameter
  - Now the vertical lines in Qini plots correctly match the spend levels used for diff_gain_summaries
- Fixed `margot_plot_qini()` to properly use custom label mappings in plot titles
  - Now tries exact match first before falling back to transform_label pattern matching
  - Handles both "model_outcome" and "outcome" key formats in label_mapping

### Minor Improvements
- Updated `margot_reversed_labels()` to use "(reduced)" instead of "(reversed)" suffix
  - Makes interpretation clearer that the outcome direction has been reduced/flipped
  - Affects all flipped outcome labels throughout the package
- Enhanced `margot_interpret_rate_comparison()` output with richer information
  - Now includes RATE estimates and 95% CIs for all reported outcomes
  - Added section for negative RATE estimates with explicit caution against CATE prioritisation
  - Added summary of unreliable outcomes where neither method found significant heterogeneity
  - More informative comparison text suitable for academic reporting
  - Reformatted output to use flowing paragraph text instead of bullets and choppy sentences
  - All information now presented as cohesive paragraphs suitable for direct inclusion in academic papers

### Policy Tree Interpretation Updates (2025-07-20)
- Modified `margot_interpret_policy_batch()` output formatting:
  - Removed "Policy tree analysis results:" line after the heading
  - Now displays clean output with just the heading followed by findings
- Enhanced `margot_interpret_policy_tree()` clarity:
  - Added "at the end of study" to all Findings headings for temporal clarity
  - Added "baseline" prefix to all variable names in tree splits and leaf descriptions
  - This disambiguation makes it clear that splits are based on baseline characteristics, not outcomes
- Simplified CATE reporting in leaf descriptions:
  - Removed confusing interpretations about treatment "improving" or "worsening" outcomes
  - Now simply states the CATE value without subjective interpretation
  - More appropriate for standardized outcomes where negative values are common
  - Overall policy advice remains in the summary section

### Policy Tree Plotting Updates (2025-07-20)
- Enhanced `margot_plot_policy_tree()` to clarify baseline variables:
  - Added "(baseline)" to axis labels on all policy tree plots
  - Added "(baseline)" to plot titles and subtitles
  - Updated both depth-1 and depth-2 plots for consistency
- Updated `transform_var_name()` helper function:
  - Now removes "_l" suffix from variable names
  - Capitalizes NZSEI and NZDEP acronyms properly
  - Example: "t0_nzsei_13_l" now displays as "NZSEI 13"

\title{Back Transform Z-Score to Original Log-Transformed Scale}
\usage{
back_transform_log_z(z_scores, log_mean, log_sd)
}
\arguments{
\item{z_scores}{A numeric value or vector of z-scores to be transformed back to the original scale.}

\item{log_mean}{The mean of the log-transformed dataset from which the z-scores were calculated.}

\item{log_sd}{The standard deviation of the log-transformed dataset from which the z-scores were calculated.}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric value or vector of the original scale values corresponding to the input z-scores.
}
\description{
This function takes z-scores and transforms them back to their original values
where the data was originally log-transformed. It performs a two-step transformation:
first converting z-scores back to log values using the log-scale mean and standard deviation,
then exponentiating to return to the original scale.
}
\examples{
# Given log-transformed data with log_mean = 1.5 and log_sd = 0.5
original_value <- back_transform_log_z(z_scores = 1.2, log_mean = 1.5, log_sd = 0.5)
print(original_value)

# Multiple z-scores can be transformed at once
z_scores <- c(-1, 0, 1, 2)
original_values <- back_transform_log_z(z_scores = z_scores, log_mean = 1.5, log_sd = 0.5)
print(original_values)

# Real-world example: back-transforming household income z-scores
# Get mean and sd from original log-transformed data
log_mean_inc <- mean(original_df$t0_log_household_inc, na.rm = TRUE)
log_sd_inc <- sd(original_df$t0_log_household_inc, na.rm = TRUE)

# Back-transform all z-scores in the dataset
original_data_scale <- back_transform_log_z(
  df_grf$t0_log_household_inc_z,
  log_mean = log_mean_inc,
  log_sd = log_sd_inc
)
head(original_data_scale)

# Interpret key points on the distribution (-1 SD, mean, +1 SD)
z_scores <- c(-1, 0, 1)
scale_values <- back_transform_log_z(
  z_scores,
  log_mean = log_mean_inc,
  log_sd = log_sd_inc
)

# Create a data frame to display the relationship between z-scores and original values
results_df <- data.frame(
  z_score = z_scores,
  data_scale = scale_values
)
print(results_df) # Shows what values on the original scale correspond to each z-score

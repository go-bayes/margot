\usage{
margot_planned_subgroups_batch(
  domain_models,
  X,
  base_defaults,
  label_mapping = NULL,
  subset_types,
  original_df,
  domain_names,
  subtitles,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{domain_models}{list of model sets; one element per outcome domain}

\item{X}{model matrix (or data frame) of predictors used when the models were
fitted}

\item{base_defaults}{named list of default arguments passed to the downstream
plotting / helper functions}

\item{label_mapping}{named list of variable-to-label mappings; passed down to `margot_plot()`}

\item{subset_types}{named list of subset specifications (e.g., list(wealth = subsets_standard_wealth))}

\item{original_df}{the raw data frame containing all variables (needed for
label recovery, plotting on the original scale, etc.)}

\item{domain_names}{character vector naming each element in `domain_models`}

\item{subtitles}{character vector of subtitles used in plot annotations;
must be the same length as `domain_names`}

\item{adjust}{character; correction method for multiple comparisons in plots.
one of "none", "bonferroni", or "holm". default: "none".}

\item{alpha}{numeric; significance threshold for correction. default: 0.05.}

\item{...}{any additional arguments forwarded directly to [`margot_subset_batch()`]}
}
\value{
a nested list. the first level is the domain name; the second level
  is the subset type. each leaf contains the full list returned by
  `margot_subset_batch()`.
}
\description{
runs the same planned subgroup contrasts (e.g., wealth, ethnicity,
political orientation) over multiple outcome domains, with optional
correction for multiple comparisons.

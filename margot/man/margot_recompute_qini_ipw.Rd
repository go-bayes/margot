\title{Recompute QINI Curves Using IPW Scores}
\usage{
margot_recompute_qini_ipw(
  margot_result,
  model_name = NULL,
  treatment_var = NULL,
  W.hat = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{margot_result}{A list returned by \code{margot_causal_forest()}.}

\item{model_name}{Character string specifying which model to recompute. 
If NULL (default), all models will be recomputed.}

\item{treatment_var}{Character string specifying the treatment variable name.
If NULL, the function will try to detect it automatically.}

\item{W.hat}{Numeric vector of propensity scores. If NULL, will use
propensity scores from the model or estimate them.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints progress messages. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A modified version of the input margot_result with updated QINI
  curves based on IPW scores. The structure remains compatible with all
  existing plotting and interpretation functions.
}
\description{
Recomputes QINI curves for binary treatment causal forest models using 
Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) scores. This is a simpler alternative
to \code{margot_recompute_qini_aipw()} that uses IPW scores only.
}
\details{
This function provides a way to recompute QINI curves using the modern
maq API with IPW scores. It's useful for:
\itemize{
  \item Debugging QINI curve differences
  \item Faster computation compared to AIPW
  \item Ensuring consistency across different model computations
}

The function handles various data storage patterns including models stored
in the results list or in a separate full_models list.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Recompute QINI curves with IPW for all models
results_ipw <- margot_recompute_qini_ipw(margot_results)

# Recompute for a specific model
results_ipw <- margot_recompute_qini_ipw(
  margot_results, 
  model_name = "model_anxiety"
)

# Specify treatment variable if auto-detection fails
results_ipw <- margot_recompute_qini_ipw(
  margot_results, 
  treatment_var = "t1_treatment"
)

# Compare with AIPW results
results_aipw <- margot_recompute_qini_aipw(margot_results)
# Plot both for comparison
}

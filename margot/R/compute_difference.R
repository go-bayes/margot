#' Compute Difference in Average Treatment Effects or Relative Risk Ratio Between Two Subgroups
#'
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`
#' This function is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
#' Please use the new `margot_compare_groups()` function and associated workflow instead.
#'
#' This function calculates either the difference in average treatment effects (ATE) or the relative risk ratio (RRR)
#' between two independent subgroups. Each subgroup is represented as a list that includes the estimated effect (theta) and
#' the standard error (std.error) of the effect. The result includes both a data frame and an interpretation
#' string formatted for easy use with `glue::glue` in Quarto documents etc. The subgroups are expected to be
#' outputs from the `lmtp::lmtp_contrast()` function.
#'
#' @param group1 A list containing the estimated effect and standard error of subgroup 1.
#'               Expected structure: list(vals = data.frame(theta = x, std.error = y)).
#' @param group2 A list containing the estimated effect and standard error of subgroup 2.
#'               Expected structure: list(vals = data.frame(theta = x, std.error = y)).
#' @param type A character string specifying the type of calculation. "RD" for risk difference (default),
#'             "RR" for relative risk ratio.
#'
#' @return A list containing:
#'         - `results`: A data frame with columns `mean_difference`, `std_error`, `conf_low`, and `conf_high` for type "RD",
#'           or `rrr`, `std_error_log`, `conf_low`, and `conf_high` for type "RR", each rounded to 4 decimal places.
#'           Suitable for direct use in reporting.
#'         - `interpretation`: A string providing a formatted interpretation of the results.

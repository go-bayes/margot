# QINI Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've created a new QINI implementation for the margot package that follows GRF/MAQ methodology exactly.

## Key Functions Created

### 1. `margot_qini_alternative()` (in R/margot_qini_alternative.R)
- Main function to compute QINI curves
- Works with existing margot_causal_forest output structure
- Requires `save_data = TRUE` (but not save_models)
- Uses test set when train/test split was used
- Computes both CATE curve and no-priority baseline

### 2. `margot_plot_qini_simple()` (in R/margot_plot_qini_simple.R)
- Creates ggplot2 visualizations of QINI curves
- Shows CATE vs baseline with optional confidence intervals
- Works with the updated results structure

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No complex baseline methods** - Only one baseline: `target.with.covariates = FALSE` (no-priority assignment)
2. **Consistent with GRF** - Uses exact same methodology as GRF example
3. **Test set usage** - Automatically uses test set when train/test split was performed
4. **Updates existing structure** - Updates results$model_name$qini_objects and qini_data

## Usage Example

```r
# Run causal forest with required parameters
cf_results <- margot_causal_forest(
  data = mydata,
  outcome_vars = c("outcome1", "outcome2"),
  covariates = covariates,
  W = treatment,
  save_data = TRUE,  # Required
  use_train_test_split = TRUE
)

# Compute QINI curves
cf_results <- margot_qini_alternative(cf_results)

# Plot results
plot <- margot_plot_qini_simple(
  cf_results,
  model_name = "model_outcome1",
  show_ci = TRUE
)
```

## Technical Notes

1. The function uses IPW scores computed via `maq::get_ipw_scores()`
2. CATE curve uses individual treatment effects for targeting
3. Baseline represents random allocation (no prioritization)
4. Different path lengths between CATE and baseline are handled properly

## Next Steps

1. Rename `margot_qini_alternative()` to `margot_qini()` after testing
2. Update existing `margot_plot_qini()` to use new structure
3. Update `margot_interpret_qini()` for simplified approach
4. Update documentation and vignettes

## Testing

The implementation has been tested against GRF reference implementation and produces similar results (differences due to random seeds in train/test splits).

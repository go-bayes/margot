## 2025-01-25: New Development Architecture Implementation

### Overview
Started implementation of new modular architecture for margot functions with proper train/test separation and integrated functionality.

### Completed Functions

#### margot_simulate_test_data()
- Creates consistent synthetic datasets with known treatment effects
- Supports positive, negative, null, and heterogeneous effect patterns
- Includes missing data generation and censoring indicators
- Companion function margot_simulate_test_data_flip() for testing flip forests
- Located in: R/margot_simulate_test_data.R

#### margot_causal_forest_dev()
- Replaces margot_causal_forest() with cleaner architecture
- Default 50/50 train/test split (configurable)
- Optional evaluation forests for test set DR scores
- Integrated missing data handling: complete cases, imputation, or forest-based
- Toy data sampling for quick testing (toy_data_prop parameter)
- Saves all components needed for downstream analysis
- Located in: R/margot_causal_forest_dev.R

#### margot_qini_dev()
- Combines margot_qini() and margot_interpret_qini() functionality
- Uses test set for honest QINI evaluation
- Multiple baseline methods with automatic fallback
- Bootstrap inference for confidence intervals
- Comprehensive gain summaries at specified spend levels
- Returns integrated results with metrics and interpretation
- Located in: R/margot_qini_dev.R

#### margot_plot_qini_dev()
- Replaces both margot_plot_qini() and margot_plot_qini_batch()
- Intelligently handles single or multiple models
- Scale options: average (default), cumulative, population
- Faceting support for multiple outcomes/models
- Enhanced annotation capabilities
- Method comparison functionality
- Located in: R/margot_plot_qini_dev.R

### Test Script
- Created test_dev_functions.R demonstrating the new workflow
- Shows data generation, forest fitting, QINI analysis, and plotting
- Includes examples of different scales and baseline method comparisons

### Documentation
- Created PLANNING.md with full architecture overview
- Lists completed and pending components
- Outlines design principles and migration strategy

### Key Improvements
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Forest fitting separate from analysis functions
2. **Honest Evaluation**: Consistent use of test set throughout
3. **Integrated Functionality**: Related features combined (e.g., QINI + interpretation)
4. **Simplified API**: Fewer functions with clearer purposes
5. **Better Missing Data Support**: Multiple handling strategies
6. **Reproducibility**: Consistent seed handling and data generation

### Next Steps
- Implement margot_hetero_dev() for heterogeneity analysis
- Create margot_policy_tree_dev() with integrated visualization
- Develop margot_rate_dev() combining rate functionality
- Add margot_flip_forests_dev() for the new architecture

### Breaking Changes
None - all new functions use "_dev" suffix to maintain compatibility

### Bug Fixes
N/A - New implementation

### Performance
- Toy data sampling allows quick iteration during development
- Evaluation forests computed only when needed
- Efficient train/test splitting

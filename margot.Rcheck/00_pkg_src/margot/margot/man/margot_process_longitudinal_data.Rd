\title{process longitudinal data for three waves}
\usage{
margot_process_longitudinal_data(
  df_wide,
  ordinal_columns = NULL,
  continuous_columns_keep = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_wide}{a wide-format dataframe containing longitudinal data for three waves.}

\item{ordinal_columns}{a character vector of column names to be treated as ordinal and dummy-coded.}

\item{continuous_columns_keep}{a character vector of continuous column names to keep without scaling.}
}
\value{
a processed dataframe suitable for use in longitudinal analyses with three waves.
}
\description{
this function processes longitudinal data for exactly three waves (t0, t1, t2).
it handles attrition, scales baseline variables, and optionally encodes ordinal variables.
note: this function is currently implemented for three waves only.
}
\details{
the function performs the following steps:
1. creates na conditions for t0 and t1 based on missingness in subsequent waves.
2. handles non-factor and factor columns, applying attrition logic.
3. scales numeric baseline (t0) variables.
4. selects and orders columns.
5. optionally encodes ordinal columns.
}
\note{
this function is specifically designed for datasets with exactly three waves (t0, t1, t2).
it may not work correctly for datasets with fewer or more waves.
}
\examples{
# assuming df_wide is your wide-format dataframe with three waves
processed_data <- margot_process_longitudinal_data(
  df_wide,
  ordinal_columns = c("education", "income_category"),
  continuous_columns_keep = c("age", "bmi")
)
}

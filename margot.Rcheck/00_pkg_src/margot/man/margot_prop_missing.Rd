\title{Proportion of missing data at baseline}
\usage{
margot_prop_missing(data, wave_col = "wave")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the dataset.}

\item{wave_col}{A character string. Name of the column that indicates the wave.
The default is "wave".}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the proportion of missing data at the baseline wave.
}
\description{
This function calculates the proportion of missing data at a baseline wave.
If a wave column is present, it uses the lowest number or lowest factor level as the baseline.
If no wave column is found, it issues a warning and uses the entire dataset.
}
\examples{
# Example using a dataset with a wave column
# assume dat_long has a column called wave
margot_prop_missing(dat_long)

# Example using a dataset without a wave column
# assume some_data is a dataset with no wave column
margot_prop_missing(some_data)
}

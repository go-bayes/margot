\usage{
margot_recompute_ate(
  causal_forest_output,
  target_sample = c("all", "treated", "control", "overlap"),
  method = "AIPW",
  scale = c("RD", "RR"),
  delta = 1,
  sd = 1,
  subset = NULL,
  respect_train_test_split = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{causal_forest_output}{Output from `margot_causal_forest()` or
`margot_causal_forest_parallel()`. Must have been run with `save_models = TRUE`.}

\item{target_sample}{Character string specifying the target sample for ATE estimation.
Options are:
\itemize{
  \item "all" - All units (default in original models)
  \item "treated" - Only treated units (ATT)
  \item "control" - Only control units (ATC)
  \item "overlap" - Units with propensity scores away from 0 and 1
}}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the estimation method. Currently only
"AIPW" (Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting) is supported by grf.}

\item{scale}{Character string specifying the scale of the estimate. Either "RD"
(risk difference) or "RR" (risk ratio). Default is "RD".}

\item{delta}{The hypothesized increase in outcome for RD scale E-value calculations.
Default is 1.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the outcome for RD scale E-value calculations.
Default is 1.}

\item{subset}{Optional logical vector for subsetting the data. Default is NULL.}

\item{respect_train_test_split}{Logical. If TRUE and the original analysis used
use_train_test_split=TRUE, computes treatment effects on the test set only for
consistency with policy evaluation. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list with the same structure as the original causal forest output, but with:
  \itemize{
    \item Updated `ate` values in each model's results
    \item Recomputed `custom_table` with new E-values and renamed effect columns (ATE/ATT/ATC/ATO)
    \item Updated `combined_table` with all new estimates
    \item A new element `ate_params` documenting the parameters used
  }

\description{
This function allows recomputation of average treatment effects (ATEs) from fitted
causal forest models using different target samples or estimation methods without
refitting the models. This is useful for sensitivity analysis and exploring
treatment effects in different subpopulations.
}
\details{
This function requires that the original causal forest models were saved
(using `save_models = TRUE`). It extracts the fitted models and recomputes
ATEs using the specified target sample.

The different target samples represent different estimands:
- "all": Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for the entire population
- "treated": Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)
- "control": Average Treatment Effect on the Control (ATC)
- "overlap": ATE for units with good overlap in propensity scores
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# First fit causal forest models with saved models
cf_results <- margot_causal_forest(
  data = mydata,
  outcome_vars = outcomes,
  covariates = X,
  save_models = TRUE
)

# Later, get ATEs for different target populations
ate_overlap <- margot_recompute_ate(cf_results, target_sample = "overlap")
ate_treated <- margot_recompute_ate(cf_results, target_sample = "treated")

# Compare estimates
cf_results$combined_table # Original (all units)
ate_overlap$combined_table # Overlap units only
ate_treated$combined_table # Treated units only
}

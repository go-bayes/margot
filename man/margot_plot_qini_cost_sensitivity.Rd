\title{Plot QINI Curves Across Treatment Cost Scenarios}
\usage{
margot_plot_qini_cost_sensitivity(
  cost_sensitivity_result,
  model_name,
  plot_type = c("overlay", "facet"),
  show_baseline = TRUE,
  colors = NULL,
  title = NULL,
  subtitle = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost_sensitivity_result}{Output from margot_qini_cost_sensitivity()}

\item{model_name}{Character string specifying which model to plot}

\item{plot_type}{Character; either "overlay" (all costs on one plot) or
"facet" (separate panel for each cost). Default is "overlay".}

\item{show_baseline}{Logical; whether to show baseline curves. Default is TRUE.}

\item{colors}{Optional vector of colors for different cost scenarios.
If NULL, uses a gradient from blue (low cost) to red (high cost).}

\item{title}{Optional plot title. If NULL, auto-generated based on model name.}

\item{subtitle}{Optional plot subtitle. If NULL, describes the cost scenarios.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to ggplot2 functions}
}
\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
Visualizes how QINI curves change with different treatment costs, showing
the impact of budget constraints on optimal treatment allocation.
}
\details{
This function creates visualizations showing how QINI curves change with
treatment cost. Lower costs result in steeper curves (more people can be
treated cost-effectively), while higher costs result in shallower curves
(only highest-effect individuals justify treatment).

The "overlay" plot type shows all cost scenarios on one plot with different
colors, making it easy to compare curve shapes. The "facet" plot type creates
separate panels for each cost, useful when curves overlap significantly.

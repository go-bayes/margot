  models_binary,

  dpi = 300,
  width = 12,
  height = 8,

}
\arguments{
\item{models_binary}{A list of model results, where each element contains a 'rate_result' component.}

\item{model_names}{Optional character vector of model names to process. Default NULL (all models).}

\item{dpi}{The resolution of the saved plots in dots per inch. Default is 300.}

\item{width}{The width of the saved plots in inches. Default is 12.}

\item{height}{The height of the saved plots in inches. Default is 8.}

\item{save_plots}{Logical indicating whether to save the plots to disk. Default is TRUE.}

\item{output_dir}{The directory where plots should be saved. Default is "rate_plots".}
}
\value{
A list containing the generated ggplot objects for each processed model.
}
\description{
This function processes a subset of models (or all models by default), creates RATE (Rank Average Treatment Effect)
plots for each model using the margot package, and optionally saves the plots.

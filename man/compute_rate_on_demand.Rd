\title{Compute RATE (Rank Average Treatment Effect) On-Demand}
\usage{
compute_rate_on_demand(
  forest,
  tau_hat = NULL,
  target = c("AUTOC", "QINI"),
  q = seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1),
  policy = c("treat_best", "withhold_best"),
  subset = NULL,
  use_oob_predictions = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  seed = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{A causal_forest object from grf}

\item{tau_hat}{Optional vector of treatment effect estimates. If NULL, will be
computed from the forest using out-of-bag predictions by default.}

\item{target}{Character; either "AUTOC" or "QINI"}

\item{q}{Numeric vector of quantiles at which to evaluate the TOC. Default is
seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1) which matches the GRF default.}

\item{policy}{Character; either "treat_best" (default) or "withhold_best"}

\item{subset}{Optional indices for subsetting the evaluation data}

\item{use_oob_predictions}{Logical; if TRUE and tau_hat is NULL, use out-of-bag
predictions for better validity (default TRUE)}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print informative messages (default FALSE)}

\item{seed}{Optional random seed for reproducibility}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to grf::rank_average_treatment_effect()}
}
\value{
A rank_average_treatment_effect object from grf
}
\description{
This internal helper function computes RATE metrics (AUTOC or QINI) on-demand
from a causal forest and treatment effect estimates. It ensures proper 
out-of-sample validation when possible.
}
\details{
For valid statistical performance, the prioritization scores (tau_hat) should
be constructed independently from the evaluation forest training data. This
function attempts to ensure this by:
- Using out-of-bag predictions when tau_hat is not provided
- Supporting subset indices for proper train/test splitting
- Warning when validation might be compromised

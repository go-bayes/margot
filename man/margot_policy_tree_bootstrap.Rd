\arguments{
\item{model_results}{List returned by margot_causal_forest() or margot_flip_forests()}

\item{model_names}{Character vector of model names to analyze. NULL = all models.}

\item{custom_covariates}{Character vector of covariate names to use for policy trees.
If NULL, uses the original top variables from the model.}

\item{exclude_covariates}{Character vector of covariate names or patterns to exclude.
Supports exact matches and regex patterns (e.g., "_log" excludes all variables
containing "_log").}

\item{covariate_mode}{Character string specifying how to handle covariates:
"original" (use original top variables), "custom" (use only custom_covariates),
"add" (add custom to existing), "all" (use all available covariates).}

\item{depth}{Numeric or character specifying which depth(s) to compute:
1 for single split, 2 for two splits (default), or "both" for both depths.}

\item{n_bootstrap}{Integer. Number of bootstrap iterations (default 300).}

\item{vary_type}{Character. Type of variation: "split_only" (vary train/test split via seeds), 
"sample_only" (bootstrap resample), "both" (resample + split). Default is "split_only".}

\item{consensus_threshold}{Numeric. Minimum inclusion frequency for consensus (default 0.5).}

\item{train_proportion}{Numeric. Train/test split when vary_train_proportion = FALSE (default 0.5).}

\item{vary_train_proportion}{Logical. Whether to vary train proportion (default FALSE).}

\item{train_proportions}{Numeric vector. Proportions to cycle through when 
vary_train_proportion = TRUE (default c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7)).}

\item{label_mapping}{Named character vector for converting variable names to readable labels.}

\item{return_consensus_trees}{Logical. Return fitted consensus trees (default TRUE).}

\item{metaseed}{Integer. Master seed for reproducibility (default 12345).}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Use parallel processing (default FALSE).}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of cores for parallel processing.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages (default TRUE).}

\item{seed}{Integer. Additional seed parameter for compatibility (default 12345).}

\item{tree_method}{Character string specifying the package to use: "policytree" 
(default) or "fastpolicytree". The fastpolicytree package provides ~10x faster
computation, which is particularly beneficial for bootstrap analysis. Falls 
back to policytree if fastpolicytree is not installed.}

\value{
Object of class "margot_bootstrap_policy_tree" containing:
\itemize{
  \item results: List with consensus trees and bootstrap metrics per model
  \item summary_metrics: Variable importance and convergence diagnostics
  \item metadata: Bootstrap parameters and seeds used
}
}
\description{
Performs bootstrap analysis of policy trees to assess stability and generate
consensus trees. By default, varies random seeds to create different train/test
splits rather than bootstrap resampling, as trees are highly sensitive to data
perturbations. Uses memory-efficient streaming approach to handle large datasets.
}
\details{
The function uses a memory-efficient approach:
\itemize{
  \item Processes one tree at a time
  \item Extracts only essential split information
  \item Accumulates statistics without storing all trees
  \item Reconstructs single consensus trees for compatibility
}

By default, the function varies random seeds to create different train/test splits
for each iteration rather than using bootstrap resampling. This is because decision
trees are highly sensitive to small data perturbations, and seed variation provides
a more realistic assessment of tree stability.
}
\section{Theoretical Background}{

Policy trees inherit the instability of decision trees, where small changes in
the data can lead to completely different tree structures (Breiman, 1996). This
instability is particularly pronounced when predictors are correlated, as the tree
can arbitrarily choose between similar variables at split points. Athey and Wager's
(2021) policy learning framework acknowledges these challenges while providing
methods to extract robust insights despite the instability.

The bootstrap analysis helps distinguish between:
\itemize{
  \item Fundamental instability due to weak or absent treatment effect heterogeneity
  \item Apparent instability due to correlated predictors that capture similar information
  \item Robust patterns that emerge consistently across different data samples
}

Important: While stability is desirable, research shows that depth-2 trees typically
outperform both uniform treatment assignment and more stable depth-1 trees, even
when the depth-2 trees show high variability. The goal is to understand and quantify
instability, not necessarily to eliminate it.

Use the companion functions `margot_assess_variable_correlation()` and 
`margot_stability_diagnostics()` to better understand the sources of instability.

Three types of variation are supported:
\itemize{
  \item "both": Varies both bootstrap sampling and train/test splits
  \item "sample_only": Only bootstrap resampling, fixed train/test split
  \item "split_only": Fixed sample, only varies train/test split
}
}

\title{Save Data Frame to Parquet File in a Specified Directory}
\usage{
here_save_arrow(df, name)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame to be saved. This is the object you want to persist to disk in Parquet format.}

\item{name}{Character string specifying the base name of the file (without the ".parquet" extension).}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. The primary effect of this function is the side effect of writing a parquet file to disk.
}
\description{
Saves the provided data frame as a parquet file using the specified name, within a directory defined by `push_mods`.
This function leverages the `arrow` and `here` packages to write data frames to parquet format and construct the file path in a consistent, platform-independent manner.
}
\details{
The `push_mods` variable must be defined in the user's environment or within the package, pointing to the directory where files will be saved.
It is presumed that `push_mods` is properly set up to point to an existing directory path. The function does not create directories; it assumes that the specified directory already exists.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `push_mods` is set in your environment to "~/mydata"
my_df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = letters[1:5])
here_save_arrow(my_df, "my_saved_dataframe")

}

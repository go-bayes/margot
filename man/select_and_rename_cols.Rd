\title{Select and Rename Columns Based on Criteria}
\usage{
select_and_rename_cols(
  names_base,
  baseline_vars,
  outcome,
  from_prefix = "t2",
  to_prefix = "t0"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{names_base}{A character vector of column names from which to select.}

\item{baseline_vars}{A character vector of baseline variables to match in `names_base`.}

\item{outcome}{The name of the outcome variable whose prefix should be replaced.}

\item{from_prefix}{The original prefix of the outcome variable to be replaced,
defaulting to "t2". The prefix should include any character immediately
preceding the numeric value and underscore, e.g., "t2_".}

\item{to_prefix}{The new prefix to replace the original prefix in the outcome
variable, defaulting to "t0". The prefix should be in the same format as
`from_prefix`, including the character immediately preceding the numeric value
and underscore, e.g., "t0_".}
}
\value{
A character vector of selected column names with the outcome variable name
  modified to reflect the new prefix.
}
\description{
Selects columns from a base set that match specified baseline variables and renames
an outcome variable by changing its prefix. Useful for longitudinal data where
time-point prefixes need to be standardized or adjusted.
}
\examples{
names_base <- c("t1_age", "t2_weight", "t3_height", "t2_outcome")
baseline_vars <- c("age", "weight")
outcome_var <- "t2_outcome"

final_columns <- select_and_rename_cols(names_base, baseline_vars, outcome_var, "t2", "t0")
print(final_columns)

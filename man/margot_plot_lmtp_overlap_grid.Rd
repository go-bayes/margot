\title{Plot LMTP density-ratio grid (waves x shifts)}
\usage{
margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid(
  x,
  outcome,
  shifts = NULL,
  label_mapping = NULL,
  scale = "linear",
  theme = "empty",
  ymax = NULL,
  digits = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{LMTP run output with `$models` or any input accepted by
`margot_lmtp_overlap()`.}

\item{outcome}{Character outcome to plot (required).}

\item{shifts}{Optional character vector of shifts to include (full or
cleaned names).}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional label map for pretty titles.}

\item{scale}{Character, "log10" or "linear" for the ratio scale (passed to
`margot_lmtp_overlap()`).}

\item{theme}{Character ggplot theme keyword passed to
`margot_lmtp_overlap()`.}

\item{ymax}{Optional numeric y-axis maximum for histogram counts across
panels (passed to `margot_lmtp_overlap_plot_grid()`).}

\item{digits}{Integer rounding for summaries (not used in plot aesthetics).}
}
\value{
A patchwork grid object.
}
\description{
Thin wrapper around `margot_lmtp_overlap()` and
`margot_lmtp_overlap_plot_grid()` that returns a panel grid with optional
harmonised or user-specified y-axis limits for histogram counts.

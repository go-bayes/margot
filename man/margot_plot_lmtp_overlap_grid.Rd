\arguments{
\item{x}{LMTP run output with `$models` or any input accepted by
`margot_lmtp_overlap()`.}

\item{outcome}{Character outcome to plot (required).}

\item{shifts}{Optional character vector of shifts to include (full or
cleaned names).}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional label map for pretty titles.}

\item{show_censored}{Logical; if FALSE (default), histograms exclude zeros (r = 0).
If TRUE, includes zeros. Censoring rate always shown in titles.}

\item{scale}{Character, "log10" or "linear" for the ratio scale (passed to
`margot_lmtp_overlap()`).}

\item{theme}{Character ggplot theme keyword passed to
`margot_lmtp_overlap()`.}

\item{ymax}{Optional numeric y-axis maximum for histogram counts across
panels (passed to `margot_lmtp_overlap_plot_grid()`).}

\item{digits}{Integer rounding for summaries (not used in plot aesthetics).}

\item{annotate_graph}{Character; controls graph annotations: `"waves"` places wave labels at top,
`"shifts"` places shift labels at top, `"none"` disables annotations (default: `"none"`).}

\item{annotate_zeros}{Logical; if TRUE, adds "zeros: X%" label to top-right of each panel.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{waves}{Optional integer vector specifying which waves to include (e.g., `c(1, 2, 3)`). If NULL,
includes all waves found for the outcome.}

\item{ymax_harmonize}{Character or named vector; controls y-axis harmonization: `"none"` (default) gives
each plot independent y-scale, `"row"` harmonizes within rows, `"column"` harmonizes within columns,
`"global"` harmonizes all plots. Can also be a named vector with custom values (e.g., `c(wave_1 = 1000)`).}

\item{xlim_harmonize}{Character or named vector; controls x-axis harmonization: `"none"` (default) gives
each plot independent x-scale, `"row"` harmonizes within rows, `"column"` harmonizes within columns,
`"global"` harmonizes all plots. Can also be a named vector with custom values.}

\item{color_by}{Character; how histogram fills are coloured (`"wave"`,
`"shift"`, or `"constant"`).}

\item{color_by_wave}{Legacy logical alias for `color_by` (`TRUE` = `"wave"`,
`FALSE` = `"constant"`).}

\item{fill_palette}{Optional vector of colours (named or unnamed) used when colouring histograms.}

\item{text_size}{Numeric size for facet annotations (wave/shift/zeros labels).}
}
\value{
A patchwork grid object.
}
\description{
Thin wrapper around `margot_lmtp_overlap()` and
`margot_lmtp_overlap_plot_grid()` that returns a panel grid with optional
harmonised or user-specified y-axis limits for histogram counts.
}
\details{
By default, histograms show only **uncensored observations** (r > 0) as zeros
primarily reflect dropout/censoring. Use `show_censored = TRUE` to include zeros.

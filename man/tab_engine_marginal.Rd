\title{Tabulate Marginal Effects with E-Values}
\usage{
tab_engine_marginal(
  x,
  new_name,
  delta = 1,
  sd = 1,
  type = c("RD", "RR"),
  continuous_X = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or matrix containing simulation results to be processed.}

\item{new_name}{A new name to assign to the output row, typically describing the variable or model.}

\item{delta}{The assumed smallest worthwhile effect, used for E-value calculations.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the effect estimate, used for E-value calculations.}

\item{type}{Character vector specifying the scale of effect size, either "RD" or "RR".
This parameter determines how the effects are calculated and presented.}

\item{continuous_X}{Logical indicating whether the treatment variable X is continuous.
If TRUE, adjusts row names based on the type parameter.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the specified new_name as a row name. The data frame includes
        effect estimates, confidence intervals, E-values, and other relevant statistics formatted
        for easy reporting.
}
\description{
This function processes simulation results to tabulate marginal effects along with E-values,
providing a summary suited for reporting. It supports both risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR)
types of estimates and handles continuous and categorical treatment variables.
}
\examples{
# Assuming you have results from a simulation or model in `results_df`
tabulated_results <- tab_engine_marginal(
  x = results_df,
  new_name = "Treatment Effect",
  delta = 1,
  sd = 0.2,
  type = "RD"
) # Corrected 'scale' to 'type'

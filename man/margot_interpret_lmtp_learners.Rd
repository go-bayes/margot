\title{Interpret Super Learner weights for LMTP nuisance fits}
\usage{
margot_interpret_lmtp_learners(
  x,
  outcome,
  shifts = NULL,
  label_mapping = NULL,
  waves = NULL,
  remove_waves = NULL,
  component = c("both", "outcome", "treatment"),
  digits = 0,
  return = c("text", "list")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{LMTP run output (e.g., the result of [margot_lmtp()]) or any object
that exposes `$density_ratios` in the same structure as the plot helpers.}

\item{outcome}{Character scalar giving the outcome name to summarise.}

\item{shifts}{Optional character vector of shifts to include (either full
names such as `t5_pwi_z_shift_up` or cleaned suffixes such as `shift_up`).
If `NULL`, all available shifts for the outcome are used.}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list passed to [transform_label()] for
readable outcome/shift labels.}

\item{waves}{Optional integer vector of waves to keep (matching the wave index
used by the LMTP fits).}

\item{remove_waves}{Optional integer vector of waves to drop after
subsetting.}

\item{component}{Which nuisance models to include: `"both"` (default),
`"outcome"` (only `m`), or `"treatment"` (only `r`).}

\item{digits}{Integer number of decimal places to use when reporting
percentages.}

\item{return}{Either `"text"` (default) for a single character string or
`"list"` for structured components.}
}
\value{
Either a character string or a list (depending on `return`).
}
\description{
Generates concise prose describing which Super Learner components dominate
the outcome (`m`) and density-ratio (`r`) nuisance regressions across waves
and shifts. Highlights waves where a single learner receives (approximately)
all the weight, which can signal limited information (e.g., after LOCF
imputation).

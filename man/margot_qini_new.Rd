\title{Compute QINI Curves Following GRF/MAQ Methodology}
\usage{
margot_qini_new(
  margot_result,
  model_names = NULL,
  seed = 12345,
  n_bootstrap = 200,
  verbose = TRUE,
  spend_levels = NULL,
  label_mapping = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{margot_result}{Output from margot_causal_forest()}

\item{model_names}{Character vector of model names to process. If NULL (default),
processes all models.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility (default 12345)}

\item{n_bootstrap}{Integer. Number of bootstrap replicates for confidence
intervals (default 200)}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
The input margot_result object with added qini_results component containing:
  \item{cate}{MAQ object for CATE-based targeting}
  \item{baseline}{MAQ object for no-priority baseline}
  \item{test_indices}{Indices used for QINI computation}
  \item{n_test}{Number of observations used}
}
\description{
Computes QINI curves for causal forest models using the exact methodology
from GRF/MAQ packages. Uses test set data when train/test splits were used
in margot_causal_forest().
}
\details{
This function implements the standard QINI curve methodology from the GRF
and MAQ packages. It computes two curves:

1. CATE curve: Prioritizes treatment based on estimated individual treatment effects
2. Baseline curve: No-priority assignment (random allocation)

When margot_causal_forest() was run with use_train_test_split = TRUE,
QINI curves are computed on the test set only, following best practices
for avoiding overfitting in policy evaluation.

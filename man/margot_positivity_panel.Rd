\usage{
margot_positivity_panel(
  pos,
  outcome = NULL,
  shift = NULL,
  include_overall = TRUE,
  digits = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pos}{A result from `margot_lmtp_positivity()` (list with by_wave, overall, flags).}

\item{outcome}{Optional character. If provided, filter to this outcome.}

\item{shift}{Optional character. If provided, filter to this shift/policy.}

\item{include_overall}{Logical; if TRUE, include pooled "overall" rows.}

}
\value{
A data.frame (tibble if available) with a compact positivity panel.
}
\description{
Produces a compact table of positivity diagnostics for a selected
outcome/shift from `margot_lmtp_positivity()`, showing both the
all-weights summary and the positive-only (uncensored) summary.
}
\details{
The panel includes, when available: censoring mass, ESS and ESS/N,
positive-only counts and ESS+/N+, and tail probabilities for chosen
thresholds (both all and positive-only).

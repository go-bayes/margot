}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list as returned by `margot_lmtp_overlap()` or a named list of
ggplot objects keyed as `"outcome::shift::wave"`.}

\item{outcome}{Optional character. If not supplied, inferred when only a
single outcome is present in `x`. Required when multiple outcomes exist.}

\item{shifts}{Optional character vector of shifts to include; accepts full
names (e.g., `t5_pwi_z_shift_up`) or cleaned (e.g., `shift_up`). If NULL,
includes all available shifts for the outcome.}

\item{waves}{Optional integer vector specifying waves (e.g., `1:5`). If NULL,
includes all waves found for the outcome.}

\item{ncol}{Optional integer for number of columns. Defaults to number of
selected shifts.}

\item{drop_titles}{Logical; if TRUE (default), strip titles from individual
plots and add a single overall title.}

\item{title}{Optional overall title; if NULL, a default is constructed.}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list to prettify column (shift) labels
via `transform_label()` when available.}

\item{annotate_zeros}{Character; one of "column" (default), "facet", "none".
"column" appends the zeros for the top-row wave to the column title;
"facet" prints zeros in the top-right of each panel; "none" disables.}

\item{text_size}{Numeric size for facet annotations (wave/shift/zeros labels).}
}
\value{
A patchwork object combining the selected plots.
}
\description{
Given the `ratio_plots` returned from `margot_lmtp_overlap()`, build a
patchwork grid organized by waves (rows) and shifts (columns) for a single
outcome. Accepts either the full result list (with `$ratio_plots`) or the
plot list itself. Shift names may be provided as full names or cleaned
suffixes; missing cells are filled with blank panels.

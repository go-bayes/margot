\arguments{
\item{x}{A list as returned by `margot_lmtp_overlap()` or a named list of
ggplot objects keyed as `"outcome::shift::wave"`.}

\item{outcome}{Optional character. If not supplied, inferred when only a
single outcome is present in `x`. Required when multiple outcomes exist.}

\item{shifts}{Optional character vector of shifts to include; accepts full
names (e.g., `t5_pwi_z_shift_up`) or cleaned (e.g., `shift_up`). If NULL,
includes all available shifts for the outcome.}

\item{waves}{Optional integer vector specifying waves (e.g., `1:5`). If NULL,
includes all waves found for the outcome.}

\item{ncol}{Optional integer for number of columns. Defaults to number of
selected shifts.}

\item{drop_titles}{Logical; if TRUE (default), strip titles from individual
plots and add a single overall title.}

\item{title}{Optional overall title; if NULL, a default is constructed.}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list to prettify column (shift) labels
via `transform_label()` when available.}

\item{annotate_zeros}{Logical; if TRUE, adds "zeros: X%" label to top-right of each panel.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{annotate_graph}{Deprecated. Shift labels are always annotated along rows and wave labels appear
as column titles; the supplied value is ignored.}

\item{ymax_harmonize}{Character or named vector; controls y-axis harmonization: `"none"` (default) gives
each plot independent y-scale, `"row"` harmonizes within rows, `"column"` harmonizes within columns,
`"global"` harmonizes all plots. Can also be a named vector with custom values.}

\item{xlim_harmonize}{Character or named vector; controls x-axis harmonization: `"none"` (default) gives
each plot independent x-scale, `"row"` harmonizes within rows, `"column"` harmonizes within columns,
`"global"` harmonizes all plots. Can also be a named vector with custom values.}

\item{text_size}{Numeric size for facet annotations (wave/shift/zeros labels).}

\item{annotate_wave_size}{Numeric; overrides the size of the column wave titles when `drop_titles = TRUE`.}

\item{annotate_shift_size}{Numeric; controls the size of shift annotations inside each panel.}

\item{annotate_zero_size}{Numeric; controls the size of zero-percentage annotations.}
}
\value{
A patchwork object combining the selected plots.
}
\description{
Given the `ratio_plots` returned from `margot_lmtp_overlap()`, build a
patchwork grid organized by waves (rows) and shifts (columns) for a single
outcome. Accepts either the full result list (with `$ratio_plots`) or the
plot list itself. Shift names may be provided as full names or cleaned
suffixes; missing cells are filled with blank panels.

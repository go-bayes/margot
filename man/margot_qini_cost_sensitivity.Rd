\usage{
margot_qini_cost_sensitivity(
  models,
  costs = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5),
  model_names = NULL,
  spend_levels = 0.1,
  baseline_method = "maq_no_covariates",
  verbose = TRUE,
  seed = 12345
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{List returned by margot_causal_forest(), containing results
and optionally full_models.}

\item{costs}{Numeric vector of treatment costs to evaluate. Default is
c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) representing a range from cheap to expensive treatments.}

\item{model_names}{Optional character vector specifying which models to process.
Default NULL (all models).}

\item{spend_levels}{Numeric vector of spend levels for difference gain summaries.
Default is 0.1.}

\item{baseline_method}{Method for generating baseline. See margot_qini() for details.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print progress messages (default TRUE).}

\item{seed}{Integer; base seed for reproducible computations (default 12345).}
}
\value{
A list with class "margot_qini_cost_sensitivity" containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{results}: Named list where each element is a cost scenario containing
    QINI results from margot_qini()
  \item \code{costs}: The cost values used
  \item \code{models_processed}: Names of models that were processed
  \item \code{summary}: Data frame summarizing key metrics across costs
}
}
\description{
Generates QINI curves across multiple treatment cost scenarios to understand
how optimal treatment allocation changes with cost. This allows exploration
of policy recommendations under different budget constraints without rerunning
the causal forest models.
}
\details{
This function systematically varies the treatment_cost parameter in margot_qini()
to show how QINI curves and optimal treatment fractions change with cost.

Lower costs (e.g., 0.2) represent scenarios where treatment is cheap relative
to budget, resulting in steeper QINI curves and larger optimal treatment fractions.
Higher costs (e.g., 5) represent expensive treatments where only the highest-effect
individuals justify treatment.

The summary table includes the optimal treatment fraction and expected gain
at key spend levels for each cost scenario, facilitating comparison across
different budget constraints.

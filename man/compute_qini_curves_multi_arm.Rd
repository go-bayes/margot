  W.hat = NULL,
  cost = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted GRF multi-arm causal forest model.}

\item{tau_hat}{Matrix of estimated treatment effects (one column per treatment arm comparison).}

\item{Y}{Vector or matrix of observed outcomes.}

\item{W_multi}{Factor vector of multi-arm treatment assignments.}

\item{W.hat}{Optional vector of treatment probabilities (one for each arm).}

\item{cost}{Optional vector of costs (one for each arm).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, print diagnostic information during execution.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{qini_data}{A data frame containing Qini curve data for plotting.}
  \item{qini_objects}{A list of maq objects for each curve, which can be used to compute average gain.}
The qini_data has an attribute "imputed" which is TRUE if any curves were imputed with zeros.

A list containing:
  \item{qini_data}{A data frame containing Qini curve data for plotting.}
  \item{qini_objects}{A list of maq objects for each treatment comparison.}
  Returns NULL if an error occurs.

\description{
This function computes Qini curves for multi-arm treatment effects using the maq package.
It handles various edge cases and provides detailed information about the computation process.

This function computes Qini curves for multi-arm causal forests using doubly robust scores.
It handles various edge cases and provides fallback mechanisms to ensure valid outputs.
}
\details{
The function computes Qini curves for all arms combined, a baseline (no covariates),
and each individual treatment arm. It handles cases where some or all Qini objects
have zero length or are NULL, extending curves with zeros when necessary.

\title{Compute Qini Curves for Multi-Arm Treatments}
\usage{
compute_qini_curves_multi_arm(tau_hat, Y, W_multi)
}
\arguments{
\item{tau_hat}{A matrix or 3D array of estimated treatment effects. For multi-arm treatments,
this should be a matrix where each column represents a treatment arm.}

\item{Y}{A vector or matrix of observed outcomes.}

\item{W_multi}{A factor vector of treatment assignments for multi-arm treatments.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing Qini curve data for plotting, or NULL if computation fails.
  The data frame has an attribute "imputed" which is TRUE if any curves were imputed with zeros.
}
\description{
This function computes Qini curves for multi-arm treatment effects using the maq package.
It handles various edge cases and provides detailed information about the computation process.
}
\details{
The function computes Qini curves for all arms combined, a baseline (no covariates),
and each individual treatment arm. It handles cases where some or all Qini objects
have zero length or are NULL, extending curves with zeros when necessary.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
tau_hat <- matrix(rnorm(1000 * 3), nrow = 1000, ncol = 3)
Y <- rnorm(1000)
W_multi <- factor(sample(1:3, 1000, replace = TRUE))
qini_data <- compute_qini_curves_multi_arm(tau_hat, Y, W_multi)

\title{Create Ordered Variable with Custom Breaks and Auto-generated Labels}
\usage{
create_ordered_variable_custom(
  df,
  var_name,
  breaks,
  include_lowest = TRUE,
  right = TRUE,
  cutpoint_inclusive = "upper",
  inf_label = "Inf",
  neg_inf_label = "-Inf"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the variable to be transformed.}

\item{var_name}{The name of the numeric variable within the data frame to be converted into
an ordered factor. This variable should ideally be continuous.}

\item{breaks}{A numeric vector specifying the breakpoints between intervals. The breakpoints
should cover the entire range of the variable.}

\item{include_lowest}{Logical, should the lowest value be included in the first interval? Default is TRUE.}

\item{right}{Logical, should intervals be closed on the right (and open on the left)? Default is TRUE.}

\item{cutpoint_inclusive}{A character string specifying whether cutpoints should be included
in the lower or upper category. Must be either "lower" or "upper". Default is "upper".}

\item{inf_label}{A string to use for infinity in labels. Default is "Inf".}

\item{neg_inf_label}{A string to use for negative infinity in labels. Default is "-Inf".}
}
\value{
Returns the data frame with an additional column representing the ordered factor variable.
        The new column is named by combining the original variable name and the suffix "_cat".
}
\description{
This function creates an ordered categorical variable in a dataframe based on user-specified breaks.
It automatically generates labels reflecting the break points and handles various edge cases.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(x = runif(100, 0, 10))
df_updated <- create_ordered_variable_custom(df, "x", c(0, 2, 5, 10))

\title{Interpret CV RATE Results}
\usage{
margot_interpret_rate_cv(cv_results, flipped_outcomes = NULL, target = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cv_results}{A margot_cv_results object from margot_rate_cv()}

\item{flipped_outcomes}{Character vector of outcomes that were inverted
during preprocessing. Optional.}

\item{target}{Character. "AUTOC" or "QINI" (ignored when cv_results contains both).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item summary_table: Formatted table with CV results
  \item interpretation: Markdown-formatted character string summarizing the results
  \item autoc_results: AUTOC interpretation (if available)
  \item qini_results: QINI interpretation (if available)
  \item comparison: Comparison between AUTOC and QINI (if both available)
}
}
\description{
Produces a summary of which outcomes show positive, negative, or inconclusive
heterogeneous treatment effects based on cross-validation RATE analysis,
similar to margot_interpret_rate() but for CV results.
}

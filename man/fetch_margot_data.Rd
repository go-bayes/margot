\title{Fetch Margot Example Data}
\usage{
fetch_margot_data(version = "example", cache = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{Character string specifying which dataset version to fetch.
Options are:
- "example" (default): Small simulated dataset (~1MB) included in package
- "v1": Original full simulated NZAVS-style data (~27MB)
- "v2": Updated simulated data with additional waves (~35MB)
- "latest": Most recent version available}

\item{cache}{Logical. If TRUE (default), caches downloaded data locally
to avoid repeated downloads.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If FALSE (default), shows download progress.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the requested margot example data
}
\description{
Downloads or loads margot example datasets. By default, returns a small
simulated dataset suitable for examples. For the full dataset used in
publications and teaching, specify version = "full".
}
\details{
The example dataset is a small simulated dataset included with the package,
suitable for running examples and tests. The full datasets (v1, v2) are
larger simulated datasets that mirror the structure of the New Zealand
Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) but contain no real participant data.

Full datasets are hosted on the Open Science Framework (OSF) and are
downloaded on first use. Subsequent calls use the cached version unless
cache = FALSE.
}
\examples{
# load small example dataset (included in package)
df_example <- fetch_margot_data()

\dontrun{
# fetch full simulated dataset from OSF
df_full <- fetch_margot_data(version = "v1")

# fetch latest version
df_latest <- fetch_margot_data(version = "latest")

# force re-download
df_fresh <- fetch_margot_data(version = "v1", cache = FALSE)
}

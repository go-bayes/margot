\arguments{
\item{models}{Output from margot_causal_forest() containing model results}

\item{model_names}{Character vector of model names to analyse. If NULL (default),
analyses all models. Model names can be specified with or without "model_" prefix.}

\item{spend_levels}{Numeric vector of spend levels for QINI analysis.
Default is 0.1 (10 percent spend captures early heterogeneity patterns effectively).}

\item{require_any_positive}{Logical. If TRUE (default), include models that
show positive evidence in ANY method. If FALSE, require positive evidence
in ALL methods.}

\item{exclude_negative_any}{Logical. If TRUE (default), exclude models that
show negative evidence in ANY RATE test (AUTOC or QINI). Models with any
negative RATE evidence are classified as "excluded_negative_rate" and will
not appear in selected or exploratory lists.}

\item{require_omnibus}{Logical. If TRUE, only include models that pass the
omnibus calibration test. Default is FALSE.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for RATE tests. Default is 0.05.
Note: this controls which RATE estimates are considered statistically significant after
multiple testing correction.}

\item{adjust}{Character. Multiple testing adjustment method for RATE estimates.
Options include "BH" (Benjamini-Hochberg), "BY" (Benjamini-Yekutieli),
"bonferroni", "holm", "fdr", or "none". Default is "none".
Note: When use_cross_validation = TRUE (the default), only "bonferroni" or "none" are valid.
Invalid methods will be automatically converted to "none" without warning.}

\item{flipped_outcomes}{Character vector of outcome names that were flipped
(reversed) in preprocessing. Used for interpretation text.}

\item{label_mapping}{Named list for mapping model names to human-readable labels.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, show progress messages. Default is TRUE.}

\item{include_extended_report}{Logical. If TRUE (default), generate detailed academic-style report
with full statistics and confidence intervals.}

\item{rate_results}{Optional pre-computed RATE results to skip computation.}

\item{qini_results}{Optional pre-computed QINI results to skip computation.}

\item{omnibus_results}{Optional pre-computed omnibus test results to skip computation.}

\item{use_cross_validation}{Logical. If TRUE (default), use cross-validation for RATE tests
instead of standard approach. This provides confidence intervals through robust inference.}

\item{cv_num_folds}{Integer. Number of CV folds when use_cross_validation = TRUE (default 5).}

\item{cv_results}{Optional pre-computed CV results to skip computation.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility in all computations (default 12345).}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Use parallel processing for cross-validation when use_cross_validation = TRUE
(default FALSE). Note: Parallel processing is experimental and may encounter memory issues.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of cores for parallel processing when parallel = TRUE
(default all cores - 1). Only applies when use_cross_validation = TRUE.}
}

\description{
Combines evidence from multiple heterogeneity tests (RATE AUTOC, RATE QINI,
QINI curves, and omnibus calibration tests) to provide unified recommendations
about which models show treatment effect heterogeneity.

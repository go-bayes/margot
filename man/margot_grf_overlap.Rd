\usage{
margot_grf_overlap(
  model_results,
  model_names = NULL,
  exposure_name = NULL,
  label_mapping = NULL,
  plot = TRUE,
  save_plots = FALSE,
  output_dir = NULL,
  theme = "classic",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{Output from margot_causal_forest() or margot_flip_forests()}

\item{model_names}{Character vector of model names to assess. If NULL, all models.}

\item{exposure_name}{Character string naming the exposure/treatment variable. If NULL, defaults to "Treatment".}

\item{label_mapping}{Named list mapping variable names to custom labels for the exposure.}

\item{plot}{Logical indicating whether to create overlap plots. Default is TRUE.}

\item{save_plots}{Logical indicating whether to save plots. Default is FALSE.}

\item{output_dir}{Directory to save plots if save_plots is TRUE.}

\item{theme}{Character string specifying the ggplot2 theme. Default is "classic". Options include "classic", "minimal", "bw", "gray", "light", "dark", "void".}

\item{verbose}{Logical for detailed messages. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list with overlap summaries, plots, and text summary.
}
\description{
Wrapper around the original GRF overlap diagnostics. This function exists
to provide a stable, descriptive name. It delegates to
`margot_assess_overlap()` for the implementation.

\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the longitudinal data in long format.}

\item{id}{The name of the ID column identifying subjects (default is "id").}

\item{wave}{The name of the wave/time column (default is "wave").}

\item{baseline_vars}{A character vector of baseline variable names to be included at t0.}

\item{exposure_var}{A character string specifying the name of the exposure variable to be tracked across time.}

\item{outcome_vars}{A character vector of outcome variable names to be tracked across time.}

\item{confounder_vars}{An optional character vector of time-varying confounder variable names to be carried forward (default is NULL).}

\item{imputation_method}{A character string specifying the imputation method to use for baseline variables. Options are 'median' (default), 'mice', or 'none'.}

\item{include_exposure_var_baseline}{Logical indicating whether to include the exposure variable at baseline (t0).}

\item{include_outcome_vars_baseline}{Logical indicating whether to include outcome variables at baseline (t0).}
}
\value{
A wide-format data frame with each subject's observations across time points
        represented in a single row. Baseline variables, exposure variables at baseline,
        and outcome variables at baseline (if included) have missing values imputed as specified.
        NA indicators are created for variables at baseline. Exposure variables are tracked across
        waves but are not imputed beyond baseline. Outcome variables are included only at the final wave
        unless `include_outcome_vars_baseline` is `TRUE`. Confounders (if any) are carried forward using last observation carried forward (LOCF).
}
\description{
This function transforms longitudinal data from long format to wide format,
ensuring that baseline measurements are correctly labeled and included.
It handles multiple observations per subject across an indefinite number of waves,
and allows for the specification of baseline variables, exposure variables,
outcome variables, and time-varying confounders.
}
\details{
Key functionalities:
- **Imputation at Baseline**: Missing values are imputed at baseline (`t0`) for:
  - `baseline_vars`
  - `exposure_var` (if `include_exposure_var_baseline = TRUE`)
  - `outcome_vars` (if `include_outcome_vars_baseline = TRUE`)
  - 'median': For numeric variables, missing values are imputed with the median.
    For categorical variables, missing values are imputed with the mode.
  - 'mice': Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations is used.
    If MICE fails, the function falls back to median/mode imputation.
  - 'none': No imputation is performed.
- **NA Indicators**: NA indicator variables are created for all variables at baseline.
  Each variable at baseline will have a corresponding NA indicator with the suffix `_na`.
- **Exposure Variables**: Tracked across waves but never imputed beyond baseline.
- **Outcome Variables**: Included only at the final wave unless `include_outcome_vars_baseline` is `TRUE`.
- **Confounder Variables**: If specified, these are carried forward across waves using LOCF.
- **Variable Inclusion per Wave**:
  - **Baseline (`t0`)**: Includes `baseline_vars`, exposure variables (if included), outcome variables (if included), and their NA indicators.
  - **Waves `t1` to `t(y_-2)`**: Include only the exposure variables (and confounders if specified).
  - **Final Wave (`t(y_-1)`)**: Includes only the outcome variables.

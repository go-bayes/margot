\title{Combine multiple batched causal forest model objects}
\usage{
margot_bind_models(..., quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more batched model objects with the structure shown in the examples.}

\item{quiet}{Logical; if TRUE, suppresses CLI feedback messages. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A combined model object with the same structure as the inputs but containing
  all models from the input objects.
}
\description{
This function combines multiple batched causal forest model objects into a single
combined model object, provided they have compatible structures.
}
\details{
The function checks that all input model objects have the same structure and
compatible elements before combining them. It ensures that the 'not_missing'
vectors are identical across all model objects.
}
\examples{
# assuming models_binary_social, models_binary_psych, and models_binary_health exist
combined_models <- margot_bind_models(models_binary_social, models_binary_psych)

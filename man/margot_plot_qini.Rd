\arguments{
\item{mc_result}{A list containing the results from margot_multi_arm_causal_forest().}

\item{outcome_var}{A character string specifying the name of the outcome variable
to plot. This should match one of the model names in mc_result$results.}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list for custom label mappings. Keys should be original variable names
(with or without "model_" prefix), and values should be the desired display labels. Default is NULL.}

\item{spend_levels}{Numeric vector of spend levels to show with vertical lines. Default is 0.1.}

\item{show_spend_lines}{Logical indicating whether to show vertical lines at spend levels. Default is TRUE.}

\item{spend_line_color}{Color for spend level lines. Default is "red".}

\item{spend_line_alpha}{Alpha transparency for spend lines. Default is 0.5.}

\item{theme}{Character string specifying the ggplot2 theme. Default is "classic". Options include "classic", "minimal", "bw", "gray", "light", "dark", "void".}

\item{show_ci}{Logical or character indicating which confidence intervals to show. 
Options: FALSE (none), TRUE or "both" (both curves), "cate" (CATE only), "ate" (ATE only). 
Default is FALSE.}

\item{ci_alpha}{Significance level for confidence intervals. Default is 0.05.}

\item{ci_n_points}{Number of points at which to compute confidence intervals. Default is 20.}

\item{ci_ribbon_alpha}{Alpha transparency for confidence interval ribbons. Default is 0.3.}

\item{ci_ribbon_color}{Color for confidence interval ribbons. If NULL (default), uses the curve color.}

\item{horizontal_line}{Logical indicating whether to draw horizontal lines where Qini curves plateau
when the path is complete. Default is TRUE. Consistent with maq::plot() behavior.}

\item{grid_step}{Integer specifying the step size for subsampling the curve data. If NULL (default),
uses max(floor(nrow(qini_data) / 1000), 1). Set to 1 to plot all points.}

\item{return_data}{Logical indicating whether to return the plot data as a data.frame instead of
the ggplot object. Default is FALSE. When TRUE, returns data with columns: proportion, gain,
lower, upper, curve.}

\item{ylim}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the y-axis limits c(min, max). Default is NULL (automatic scaling).}

\item{fixed_ylim}{Logical; if TRUE and ylim is NULL, uses the actual data range with padding
for consistent y-axis scaling across plots. Default is FALSE.}

\item{baseline_method}{Method for generating baseline: "auto" (default), 
"maq_no_covariates", "simple", "maq_only", or "none". See details in margot_generate_qini_data().}

\item{cate_color}{Color for the CATE (targeted treatment) curve. Default is "#d8a739" (gold).}

\item{ate_color}{Color for the ATE (no-priority/uniform assignment) curve. Default is "#4d4d4d" (dark gray).}

\item{scale}{Character string specifying the scale for gains: "average" (default), "cumulative", 
or "population". "average" shows average policy effect per unit (maq default), "cumulative" 
shows traditional cumulative gains, "population" shows total population impact.}

\item{treatment_cost}{Numeric scalar; the treatment cost used in QINI calculations. Default is NULL,
which attempts to extract the cost from model metadata. If not found, assumes cost = 1.
When cost differs from stored cost, QINI curves are automatically regenerated.
When cost differs from 1, it will be shown in the plot subtitle.}

\item{seed}{Integer; seed for reproducible QINI generation when treatment_cost differs
from stored cost. Default is 12345.}

\item{x_axis}{Type of x-axis for QINI curves: "proportion" (default) or "budget".
"proportion" shows proportion of population treated (0 to 1).
"budget" shows budget per unit (0 to treatment_cost), matching maq's visualization.}
}
\value{
If return_data is FALSE (default), returns a ggplot object. If return_data is TRUE,
  returns a data.frame with the plot data.
}
\description{
This function creates a ggplot object displaying Qini curves based on the
results of a margot_multi_arm_causal_forest() model. It includes label
transformations and informative CLI messages. The function is designed to be
consistent with maq::plot() functionality while providing additional features
like theme selection and spend level indicators.
}
\details{
This function provides maq::plot() compatible features including:
\itemize{
  \item Horizontal line extension for complete paths
  \item Grid step subsampling for large datasets
  \item Data frame return option matching maq::plot() output format
  \item Standard error extraction from maq objects
}

Key differences from maq::plot():
\itemize{
  \item Uses ggplot2 instead of base R graphics
  \item More descriptive axis labels
  \item Additional features like theme selection and spend indicators
  \item Confidence intervals computed via maq::average_gain() for accuracy
  \item Binary treatment colors: Customizable via cate_color and ate_color parameters
}

\strong{Important Note on Scale:} The y-axis shows \strong{average policy effects per unit}, 
not cumulative gains. This follows the maq package implementation where gains represent 
Q(B) = E[⟨πB(Xi), τ(Xi)⟩], the expected (average) gain from treating units according 
to the policy πB. This differs from traditional uplift modeling QINI curves which show 
cumulative gains. At 100\% spend, both CATE and ATE curves converge to similar values 
because the average effect is similar regardless of treatment ordering when everyone is treated.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage - uses stored treatment cost
margot_plot_qini(cf_results, "model_anxiety")

# Auto-regenerates with different treatment cost
plot1 <- margot_plot_qini(cf_results, "model_anxiety", treatment_cost = 1)
plot2 <- margot_plot_qini(cf_results, "model_anxiety", treatment_cost = 5)

# Compare costs with fixed y-axis scaling
plot3 <- margot_plot_qini(cf_results, "model_anxiety", treatment_cost = 5, fixed_ylim = TRUE)

# Show CI only for CATE curve
plot4 <- margot_plot_qini(cf_results, "model_anxiety", show_ci = "cate")

# Show CI for both curves
plot5 <- margot_plot_qini(cf_results, "model_anxiety", show_ci = TRUE)

# Custom seed for reproducibility when regenerating
plot6 <- margot_plot_qini(cf_results, "model_anxiety", treatment_cost = 2, seed = 42)

# Using custom label mapping
label_mapping <- list(
  "anxiety" = "Anxiety Symptoms",
  "depression" = "Depression Symptoms"
)
margot_plot_qini(cf_results, "model_anxiety", label_mapping = label_mapping)
}

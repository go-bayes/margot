\title{Flip CATE Estimates for Selected Outcomes in GRF Model Results}
\usage{
margot_flip_forests(
  model_results,
  flip_outcomes,
  model_prefix = "model_",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{A list containing the model results from margot_causal_forest().}

\item{flip_outcomes}{A character vector of outcome variable names for which CATE estimates should be flipped.}

\item{model_prefix}{A character string indicating the prefix used for model names in the results list. Default is "model_".}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to display detailed messages during execution. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A modified copy of the model_results list with flipped CATE estimates and related outputs
        for the specified outcomes.
}
\description{
This function post-processes the results from margot_causal_forest to flip CATE estimates,
RATE results, QINI RATE results, and QINI curves for selected outcomes. This is useful when
you want to ensure consistent interpretation of effects across differently coded outcomes.

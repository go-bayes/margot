\usage{
margot_flip_forests(
  model_results,
  flip_outcomes,
  model_prefix = "model_",
  grf_defaults = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE,
  n_cores = future::availableCores() - 1,
  verbose = TRUE,
  remove_original = TRUE,
  qini_treatment_cost = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{A list containing the model results from margot_causal_forest().}

\item{flip_outcomes}{A character vector of outcome variable names for which models should be flipped.}

\item{model_prefix}{A character string indicating the prefix used for model names in the results list. Default is "model_".}

\item{grf_defaults}{A list of parameters to pass to the GRF causal forest models. Default is NULL,
which attempts to extract parameters from the original fitted models. Providing explicit values
ensures consistency between original and flipped models. Common parameters include num.trees,
honesty, honesty.fraction, alpha, min.node.size, and mtry.}

\item{parallel}{Logical indicating whether to use parallel processing. Default is FALSE.}

\item{n_cores}{Number of cores to use for parallel processing. Default is availableCores() - 1.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to display detailed messages during execution. Default is TRUE.}

\item{remove_original}{Logical indicating whether to remove the original (non-flipped) models after
creating their flipped versions. Default is TRUE. When TRUE, only the flipped models with "_r"
suffix remain; when FALSE, both original and flipped models are kept.}

\item{qini_treatment_cost}{Scalar treatment cost per unit for QINI calculations. Default 1.
Lower values (e.g., 0.2) represent cheap treatments creating steeper QINI curves;
higher values (e.g., 5) represent expensive treatments creating shallower curves.}
}
\value{
A modified copy of model_results with flipped models (with "_r" suffix). If remove_original
        is TRUE (default), original models are removed; otherwise both versions are kept.
}
\description{
Creates new models with reversed treatment effects by flipping the outcome variable
and recomputing the entire causal forest from scratch. New models are appended with
"_r" suffix to indicate reduced/reversed outcomes.
}
\details{
This function creates entirely new models by:
1. Extracting the original data for each outcome
2. Flipping the outcome variable (Y_flipped = -Y)
3. Calling margot_causal_forest() with the flipped outcome
4. Storing the result with "_r" suffix
5. Optionally removing the original models (default behavior)

This ensures all components (forest model, CATE estimates, QINI curves, policy trees,
E-values, etc.) are consistently computed based on the flipped outcome.

When grf_defaults is NULL, the function attempts to extract key GRF parameters from
the first fitted model to ensure consistency between original and flipped models.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Flip models and remove originals (default)
results_flipped <- margot_flip_forests(
  results,
  flip_outcomes = c("anxiety", "depression")
)
# Results now contain anxiety_r and depression_r, originals removed

# Keep both original and flipped models
results_both <- margot_flip_forests(
  results,
  flip_outcomes = c("anxiety", "depression"),
  remove_original = FALSE
)
# Results contain both anxiety/depression and anxiety_r/depression_r

# Use custom GRF parameters for flipped models
results_custom <- margot_flip_forests(
  results,
  flip_outcomes = c("anxiety", "depression"),
  grf_defaults = list(num.trees = 4000, honesty = TRUE, honesty.fraction = 0.5)
)

\usage{
margot_flip_forests(
  model_results,
  flip_outcomes,
  model_prefix = "model_",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{A list containing the model results from margot_causal_forest().}

\item{flip_outcomes}{A character vector of outcome variable names for which CATE estimates should be flipped.}

\item{model_prefix}{A character string indicating the prefix used for model names in the results list. Default is "model_".}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to display detailed messages during execution. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A modified copy of model_results with flipped models (with "_r" suffix) replacing originals.
}
\description{
Creates new models with reversed treatment effects, appending "_r" to model names.
The original models are removed and replaced with properly flipped versions where
all statistics (ATE, RATE, E-values, conditional means) are recomputed.
}
\details{
This function creates entirely new model entries with "_r" suffix rather than modifying
existing models. All statistics are properly recomputed for the flipped scenario:
- ATE is negated
- CATE estimates (tau_hat) are negated
- E-value table is recomputed with the flipped ATE
- Conditional means columns are swapped (for binary treatment)
- RATE and QINI are recomputed with flipped tau_hat
- Policy trees are marked for recalculation
}

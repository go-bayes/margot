\description{
This function runs multiple GRF causal forest models with enhanced features. In addition to estimating
causal effects, it can compute the Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect (RATE) for each model. RATE
ranks individuals based on their predicted treatment effects and calculates the average effect for selected
percentiles. When computing RATE, the \code{target_rate} parameter determines the variant: \code{"AUTOC"}
(default) exhibits greater power when only a small subset of the population experiences nontrivial heterogeneous
treatment effects, whereas \code{"QINI"} is more powerful when many individuals experience diffuse or substantial
treatment effect heterogeneity.

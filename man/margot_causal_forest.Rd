\usage{
margot_causal_forest(
  data,
  outcome_vars,
  covariates,
  W,
  weights,
  grf_defaults = list(),
  save_data = FALSE,
  compute_rate = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing all necessary variables.}

\item{outcome_vars}{A character vector of outcome variable names to be modelled.}

\item{covariates}{A matrix of covariates to be used in the GRF models.}

\item{W}{A vector of binary treatment assignments.}

\item{weights}{A vector of weights for the observations.}

\item{grf_defaults}{A list of default parameters for the GRF models.}

\item{save_data}{Logical indicating whether to save data, covariates, and weights. Default is FALSE.}

\item{compute_rate}{Logical indicating whether to compute RATE for each model. Default is TRUE.}

\item{top_n_vars}{Integer specifying the number of top variables to use for additional computations. Default is 15.}

\item{save_models}{Logical indicating whether to save the full GRF model objects. Default is TRUE.}

\item{train_proportion}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion of non-missing data to use for
training policy trees. Default is 0.7.}

\item{qini_split}{Logical indicating whether to do a separate train/test split exclusively for the Qini
calculation. Default is TRUE (i.e., Qini is computed out-of-sample).}

\item{qini_train_prop}{Proportion of data to use for the Qini training set (if \code{qini_split=TRUE}). Default is 0.7.}

\item{compute_conditional_means}{Logical indicating whether to compute conditional means using 
\code{policytree::conditional_means()}. These represent expected outcomes under each treatment arm. Default is TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to display detailed messages during execution. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  * `results` - per-outcome diagnostics and objects
  * `combined_table` - combined e-value table across outcomes
  * `outcome_vars` - vector of outcome names
  * `not_missing` - indices of complete-case rows
  * (`data`, `covariates`, `weights`, `W`) when `save_data = TRUE`
  * `full_models` when `save_models = TRUE`
}
\description{
This function runs multiple GRF causal forest models with enhanced features. In addition to estimating
causal effects, it can compute the Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect (RATE) for each model. It also
gives you the option to train a separate "Qini forest" on a subset of data and compute Qini curves on
held-out data, thereby avoiding in-sample optimism in the Qini plots.

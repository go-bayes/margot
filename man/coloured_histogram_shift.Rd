\title{Visualize Shifts in Data Distributions with Highlighted Ranges}
\usage{
coloured_histogram_shift(
  df,
  col_name,
  binwidth = 1,
  range_highlight = NULL,
  shift = "up",
  show_avg_line = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing the variable of interest.}

\item{col_name}{The name of the column in `df` to be visualized in the histogram. This should be a numeric variable.}

\item{binwidth}{The width of the bins for the histogram. Default is 1. Adjust this based on the distribution and scale of your data to create a meaningful visualization.}

\item{range_highlight}{A numeric vector of length 2 specifying the start and end of the range to highlight. If `NULL`, no range is highlighted.}

\item{shift}{A character string indicating the direction of the shift, with "up" highlighting in gold and "down" highlighting in dodger blue. The default is "up".}

\item{show_avg_line}{A logical value indicating whether to display a vertical line representing the average value of the specified column using a red dashed line. Default is `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object representing the histogram with specified highlights. This object can be printed or further modified using `ggplot2` functions.
}
\description{
This function creates a histogram that highlights a specified range of values to visualize shifts in data distributions. The highlighted range can indicate areas of interest, such as shifts up or down in the distribution. The fill colour of the histogram is dynamically adjusted based on the specified direction of the shift.
}
\examples{
# Assuming df_nz is your dataframe and it includes a numeric variable 'forgiveness'
# Filter to a specific subset, for example, wave 2019
df_19 <- dplyr::filter(df_nz, wave == 2019)

# Create and print the histogram
graph_density_of_exposure <- coloured_histogram_shift(
  df = df_19,
  shift = "down",
  col_name = "forgiveness",
  binwidth = .5, # Adjust binwidth for your data
  range_highlight = c(3.9, 10)
)
print(graph_density_of_exposure)

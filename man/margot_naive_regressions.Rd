\usage{
margot_naive_regressions(
  data,
  exposure_var,
  outcome_vars,
  scale = c("RD", "RR"),
  delta = 1,
  sd = 1,
  coefficient_scale = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing all necessary variables.}

\item{exposure_var}{A character string specifying the exposure variable name.}

\item{outcome_vars}{A character vector of outcome variable names to be modeled.}

\item{scale}{Character string specifying the scale for E-value calculation. 
Options are "RD" (risk difference, default) or "RR" (risk ratio).}

\item{delta}{The hypothesised increase in outcome for RD scale E-value calculations. 
Default value is 1.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the outcome for RD scale E-value calculations. 
Default value is 1.}

\item{coefficient_scale}{Numeric value to scale coefficients by. Default is 1 (no scaling).
Use this to interpret effects for multi-unit changes (e.g., set to 4 to get 
effects for a 4-unit change in the exposure variable).}

\item{save_output}{Logical, whether to save the complete output. Default is FALSE.}

\item{save_path}{The directory path to save the output. Default is "push_mods" 
in the current working directory.}

\item{base_filename}{The base filename for saving the output. Default is 
"naive_regressions_output".}

\item{use_timestamp}{Logical, whether to include a timestamp in the filename. 
Default is FALSE.}

\item{prefix}{Optional prefix to add to the saved output filename. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{models}{A list of lm() model objects for each outcome.}
  \item{combined_table}{A data frame with columns E[Y|A], 2.5%, 97.5%, E_Value, 
    and E_Val_bound, compatible with margot_plot().}
  \item{individual_results}{A list of individual regression summaries for each outcome.}
}
\description{
This function performs naive cross-sectional linear regressions of a single exposure 
variable on multiple outcome variables, ignoring potential confounders. It produces 
output compatible with margot_plot() to demonstrate what happens when proper causal 
inference methods are not used. The results should be interpreted as misspecified 
models that do not account for confounding.
}
\details{
This function fits simple linear regressions of the form: outcome ~ exposure.
It calculates confidence intervals and E-values for each regression coefficient.
The output uses "E[Y|A]" notation to indicate these are conditional expectations
from naive regressions, not causal effects. The E-values calculated are 
technically incorrect since they assume causal interpretation of the coefficients.

This function is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the difference
between naive associations and properly estimated causal effects.

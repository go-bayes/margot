\usage{
margot_rate_cv(
  model_results,
  num_folds = 5,
  target = c("AUTOC", "QINI"),
  model_names = NULL,
  use_full_data = TRUE,
  seed = 12345,
  verbose = TRUE,
  parallel = FALSE,
  n_cores = future::availableCores() - 1,
  future_globals_maxSize = 22,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{Output from `margot_causal_forest()` or `margot_flip_forests()`}

\item{num_folds}{Integer. Number of cross-validation folds (default 5). Must be at least 3.}

\item{target}{Character vector. RATE targets to test: "AUTOC", "QINI", or
c("AUTOC", "QINI") for both (default). When both are specified, results
are combined with adjusted p-values accounting for testing both metrics.}

\item{model_names}{Character vector. Specific models to test (default NULL tests all)}

\item{use_full_data}{Logical. If TRUE and data is available, refit forests on full data
rather than using the training split (default TRUE)}

\item{seed}{Integer or NULL. Random seed for reproducibility. If NULL, defaults to 12345}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages (default TRUE)}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Use parallel processing for multiple models (default FALSE).
Note: Parallel processing requires the margot package to be installed (not just loaded
with devtools::load_all()). If the package is not installed, the function will fall
back to sequential processing with a warning.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of cores for parallel processing when parallel = TRUE
(default all cores - 1)}

\item{future_globals_maxSize}{Numeric. Maximum allowed size for exporting globals to
parallel workers in GiB. Default is 22. Set to Inf to disable the limit.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for hypothesis tests (default 0.05).
When using Bonferroni correction, consider alpha = 0.2 due to its conservative nature.}

\item{adjust}{Character. Multiple testing adjustment method. Only "bonferroni" or "none"
are valid for cross-validation due to the martingale aggregation method. Default is "none".
Other methods like BH/BY/FDR are not statistically appropriate for CV aggregation.}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list for custom label mappings. Keys should be model names
(with or without "model_" prefix), and values should be the desired display labels.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to grf::causal_forest}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{cv_results}{Data frame with CV test results for each model}
  \item{interpretation}{Character string interpreting the results}
  \item{significant_models}{Character vector of models with significant heterogeneity}
  \item{tables}{List of formatted tables similar to margot_rate() output (rate_autoc, rate_qini)}
  \item{method_details}{List with details about the CV procedure}
}
\description{
Performs uncorrelated sequential cross-validation to test for treatment effect
heterogeneity using the approach recommended by the grf package (Wager 2024).
This method provides robust statistical testing that avoids overfitting by using
sequential, non-overlapping training sets.
}
\details{
The function implements the sequential cross-validation approach from
Wager (2024) and Nie & Wager (2020). This method:
- Splits data into K folds
- Trains on folds 1 to k-1, tests on fold k
- Aggregates t-statistics using the martingale property
- Provides valid p-values for heterogeneity testing

The null hypothesis is that there is no treatment effect heterogeneity
(all individuals have the same treatment effect).

## Multiple Testing Correction

Due to the martingale aggregation method used in CV, only Bonferroni correction
or no correction are statistically valid. Methods like Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
or false discovery rate (FDR) control are not appropriate because they assume
independent p-values, which is violated by the sequential CV structure.

Bonferroni correction is very conservative, especially with noisy heterogeneous
treatment effect models. We recommend using alpha = 0.2 when applying Bonferroni
correction to maintain reasonable statistical power.

For memory efficiency with large model objects, the function pre-extracts
only the necessary data for each model before parallel processing. However,
parallel processing is currently experimental and disabled by default due to
potential memory issues with large model objects. If you want to try parallel
processing, set parallel = TRUE and consider increasing the future.globals.maxSize
option with: options(future.globals.maxSize = 15 * 1024^3) # 15 GB

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{A list containing the model results after running margot_flip_forests().}

\item{outcomes_to_recalculate}{A character vector of outcome names to recalculate policy trees for.
If NULL, recalculates all models marked as needing recalculation.}

\item{model_prefix}{A character string indicating the prefix used for model names. Default is "model_.".}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to display detailed messages. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
An updated copy of model_results with recalculated policy trees.
}

that were processed by margot_flip_forests().

\title{This function interprets the output of causal effect analysis, providing a compact report.
It only reports coefficients and E-values with **Evidence** or **Strong evidence** for causality.
The language is suitable for scientific reports, avoiding explanations of treatment effects and E-values.
Each outcome's interpretation starts with a separate paragraph heading using `####`.
Additionally, it includes a final paragraph indicating that all other effect estimates presented
either weak or unreliable evidence for causality.}
\usage{
margot_interpret_marginal(
  df,
  type = c("RD", "RR"),
  order = "alphabetical",
  original_df = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing causal effect estimates. Expected to include columns for
outcome names, effect estimates, confidence intervals, E-values, and summary labels.
Can also be the list output from `transform_to_original_scale()`.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the type of effect estimate. Must be either "RD"
(Risk Difference) or "RR" (Risk Ratio). Default is "RD".}

\item{order}{Character string specifying the order of results. Default is "alphabetical".
- `"alphabetical"`: Orders outcomes alphabetically.
- `"magnitude"`: Orders outcomes by the absolute magnitude of the effect size in descending order.}

\item{original_df}{Optional data frame for back-transforming estimates to the original scale.}
}
\value{
A list containing one element:
  \item{interpretation}{A character string containing a compact interpretation of each outcome in `df`,
  including separate paragraph headings and sentence-cased descriptions, followed by a concluding paragraph
  if applicable.}
}

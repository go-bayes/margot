\title{Compute Difference in Means, Standard Error, and Confidence Intervals Between Two Groups}
\usage{
compute_difference_means(group1, group2)
}
\arguments{
\item{group1}{A list containing the mean and standard error of group 1.
Expected structure: list(vals = list(theta = x, std.error = y)).}

\item{group2}{A list containing the mean and standard error of group 2.
Expected structure: list(vals = list(theta = x, std.error = y)).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns `mean_difference`, `std_error`, `conf_low`, and `conf_high`,
        each rounded to 4 decimal places. Suitable for direct use in reporting.
}
\description{
This function calculates the difference in means, the standard error of the difference,
and the 95% confidence intervals between two independent groups. Each group is represented
as a list that includes the mean (theta) and the standard error (std.error) of the group.
The result is formatted for easy use with `glue::glue` in Quarto documents etc
}
\examples{
group1 <- list(vals = list(theta = 100, std.error = 10))
group2 <- list(vals = list(theta = 90, std.error = 5))
result <- compute_difference_means(group1, group2)
glue::glue("The difference in means is {result$mean_difference} with a 95\% CI of [{result$conf_low}, {result$conf_high}].")

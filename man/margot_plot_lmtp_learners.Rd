\title{Plot Super Learner weights for LMTP nuisance fits}
\usage{
margot_plot_lmtp_learners(
  x,
  outcome,
  shifts = NULL,
  label_mapping = NULL,
  waves = NULL,
  remove_waves = NULL,
  title = NULL,
  component = c("both", "outcome", "treatment")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{LMTP run output (e.g., the result of [margot_lmtp()]) or any object
that exposes `$density_ratios` in the same structure as the plot helpers.}

\item{outcome}{Character scalar giving the outcome name to summarise.}

\item{shifts}{Optional character vector of shifts to include (either full
names such as `t5_pwi_z_shift_up` or cleaned suffixes such as `shift_up`).
If `NULL`, all available shifts for the outcome are used.}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list passed to [transform_label()] for
readable outcome/shift labels.}

\item{waves}{Optional integer vector of waves to keep (matching the wave index
used by the LMTP fits).}

\item{remove_waves}{Optional integer vector of waves to drop after
subsetting.}

\item{title}{Optional plot title. Defaults to the pretty outcome label of the
requested contrast when `NULL`.}

\item{component}{Which nuisance models to include: `"both"` (default),
`"outcome"` (only `m`), or `"treatment"` (only `r`).}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object.
}
\description{
Produces a heatmap of average Super Learner weights by wave, learner, shift,
and nuisance component (outcome regression `m` and density-ratio regression
`r`). Colours encode the mean Super Learner weight averaged across
cross-fitting folds.

\title{Compute Difference in Average Treatment Effects or Relative Risk Ratio Between Two Subgroups}
\usage{
compute_difference(group1, group2, type = "RD")
}
\arguments{
\item{group1}{A list containing the estimated effect and standard error of subgroup 1.
Expected structure: list(vals = data.frame(theta = x, std.error = y)).}

\item{group2}{A list containing the estimated effect and standard error of subgroup 2.
Expected structure: list(vals = data.frame(theta = x, std.error = y)).}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of calculation. "RD" for risk difference (default),
"RR" for relative risk ratio.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
        - `results`: A data frame with columns `mean_difference`, `std_error`, `conf_low`, and `conf_high` for type "RD",
          or `rrr`, `std_error_log`, `conf_low`, and `conf_high` for type "RR", each rounded to 4 decimal places. 
          Suitable for direct use in reporting.
        - `interpretation`: A string providing a formatted interpretation of the results.
}
\description{
This function calculates either the difference in average treatment effects (ATE) or the relative risk ratio (RRR)
between two independent subgroups. Each subgroup is represented as a list that includes the estimated effect (theta) and 
the standard error (std.error) of the effect. The result includes both a data frame and an interpretation 
string formatted for easy use with `glue::glue` in Quarto documents etc. The subgroups are expected to be 
outputs from the `lmtp::lmtp_contrast()` function.
}
\examples{
group1 <- list(vals = data.frame(theta = 100, std.error = 10))
group2 <- list(vals = data.frame(theta = 90, std.error = 5))
output_rd <- compute_difference(group1, group2)
cat(output_rd$interpretation)  # Print the interpretation for risk difference

group1 <- list(vals = data.frame(theta = 3.19, std.error = 0.393))
group2 <- list(vals = data.frame(theta = 1.23, std.error = 0.228))
output_rr <- compute_difference(group1, group2, type = "RR")
cat(output_rr$interpretation)  # Print the interpretation for relative risk ratio

\usage{
margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity(
  x,
  outcome,
  shifts = NULL,
  label_mapping = NULL,
  waves = NULL,
  remove_waves = NULL,
  digits = 2,
  include_overview = TRUE,
  return = c("text", "list")
)

margot_interpret_lmtp_overlap(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{LMTP run output (e.g., the result of [margot_lmtp()]) or any object
that exposes `$density_ratios` in the same structure as the plot helpers.}

\item{outcome}{Character scalar giving the outcome name to summarise.}

\item{shifts}{Optional character vector of shifts to include (either full
names such as `t5_pwi_z_shift_up` or cleaned suffixes such as `shift_up`).
If `NULL`, all available shifts for the outcome are used.}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list passed to [transform_label()] for
readable outcome/shift labels.}

\item{waves}{Optional integer vector of wave indices to keep (matching the
column positions used by the overlap plot). Defaults to all available
waves.}

\item{remove_waves}{Optional integer vector of waves to exclude after any
inclusion via `waves`.}

\item{digits}{Integer number of decimal places to use when reporting
ESS-based fractions (e.g., `ESS/N`).}

\item{include_overview}{Logical; if `TRUE`, append a short paragraph
summarising the distribution of ESS across the selected waves and the
pooled estimates across shifts.}

\item{return}{Character; either `"text"` (default, a single markdown-ready
string) or `"list"` (detailed components including the computed ESS
tables).}
}
\value{
Either a single character string (default) or a list containing the
  header, per-shift lines, overview text, and the underlying ESS summaries
  when `return = "list"`.
}
\description{
Builds a concise textual summary of LMTP density-ratio diagnostics for a
single outcome. For each requested shift, the function computes effective
sample sizes (ESS) by wave and for the pooled person-time using
`colSums()` over the underlying density ratios. The output mirrors the
filtering and labelling conventions used by
[`margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid()`] for consistency between prose and
graphics.

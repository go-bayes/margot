\title{Assess Overlap/Positivity from LMTP Models via Density Ratios}
\usage{
margot_lmtp_overlap(
  x,
  outcomes = NULL,
  shifts = NULL,
  plot = TRUE,
  theme = "classic",
  scale = "log10",
  digits = 3,
  verbose = TRUE,
  color_by_wave = TRUE,
  bins = 40,
  binwidth = NULL,
  xlim = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{LMTP run output with `$models` (e.g., result from margot_lmtp()),
or a list compatible with `margot_lmtp_positivity()`.}

\item{outcomes}{Optional character vector of outcome names to include.}

\item{shifts}{Optional character vector of shifts/policies to include
(accepts full names like `t5_pwi_z_shift_up` or cleaned names like `shift_up`).}

\item{plot}{Logical; if TRUE, create ratio distribution plots.}

\item{theme}{ggplot2 theme keyword: "classic" (default), "minimal", "bw",
"gray", "light", "dark", "void".}

\item{scale}{Character; x-axis scale for plotted ratios: "log10" (default)
shows log10(density ratio) for w>0, or "linear" shows the raw ratio.}

\item{digits}{Integer rounding for summaries (passed to positivity helper).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; emit informative messages.}

\item{...}{Ignored. Present for backward compatibility with older
arguments like `save_plots` and `output_dir` that are being phased out.}
}
\value{
A list with:
  - overlap_summary: tibble combining by-wave and overall positivity/overlap metrics
  - ratio_plots: list of ggplot objects (if plot = TRUE)
  - flags: tibble of positivity flags
  - text_summary: brief prose summary
}
\description{
Summarizes density-ratio overlap and effective sample size (ESS) for LMTP
models using `margot_lmtp_positivity()`, and optionally creates diagnostic
plots of the density-ratio distributions by wave and shift.

\arguments{
\item{object}{A `margot_stability_policy_tree` object.}

\item{model_names}{Optional character vector of outcome names (with or without
`model_` prefix). Default: all models in `object`.}

\item{depth}{Integer; policy tree depth to summarize (default 2).}

\item{depths_by_model}{Optional named vector/list mapping models (with or without `model_`
prefix) to depth 1 or 2; overrides `depth` on a per-model basis so mixed-depth reports can
be generated.}

\item{R}{Integer ≥ 199; bootstrap replicates for reporter CIs (default 499).}

\item{seed}{Integer or NULL; RNG seed (default 42).}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list for display labels.}

\item{digits}{Integer; rounding for numeric displays (default 3).}

\item{include_stability}{Logical; include stability highlights per model (default TRUE).}

\item{include_explanation}{Logical; include policy value explanation block (default TRUE).}

\item{table_type}{Character; one of "full" (default) or "treated_only" for condensed table.}

\item{include_split_breakdown}{Character; one of "branch" (default), "leaf", or "none".
Adds a compact per-split summary per model with action-conditional treated-only uplift(s)
and contributions to policy value vs control-all and vs treat-all. Coherent by construction:
we only report uplift among treated in treated subgroups and uplift among controlled in
controlled subgroups.}

\item{split_compact}{Logical; if TRUE (default), builds compact split tables from
`split_breakdown` with reduced columns.}

\item{contrib_scale}{Character; one of "rel_abs" (default, signed share of |PV|),
"rel_signed" (share of signed PV), or "abs" (raw contribution values).}

\item{show_pvt}{Logical; include PV vs treat-all contribution column in compact tables (default FALSE).}

\item{show_ci_compact}{Logical; include CIs in compact tables (default TRUE).}

\item{min_action_pct}{Numeric (default 5); below this percent treated or controlled in a split,
suppress the corresponding action-specific uplift (report as "—").}

\item{split_drop_zero}{Logical (default TRUE); drop split rows whose PV contributions are numerically
zero for both baselines in the compact tables.}

\item{split_top_only}{Logical (default FALSE); when TRUE, retain only the top-contributing split per
model in the compact tables (helpful for depth-1 trees where complementary branches are redundant).}

\item{se_method}{Character; one of "bootstrap" (default) or "plugin" for influence-function
plug-in SEs based on per-unit DR contributions.}

\item{source_models}{Optional original model container (e.g., from `margot_causal_forest()`)
if you wish to run external audits; not required for estimation.}

\item{audit_with_policytree}{Logical; if TRUE and `source_models` are available, performs a
side-by-side audit using the original GRF predictions on the same test rows: (i) tau_hat-based
policy values PVc = mean(1{a=Treat}×tau_hat), PVT = mean(1{a=Control}×(-tau_hat)); and
(ii) conditional-means-based values using `conditional_means` if present. This helps validate
that DR-based values agree with GRF-based alternatives on the same evaluation slice.}

\item{auto_recommend}{Logical; if TRUE, compute and report restricted-policy recommendations
derived from dominant favorable split(s). Default FALSE.}

\item{dominance_threshold}{Numeric in (0,1); minimum share of |PV(control-all)| contribution to
consider a split dominant (default 0.6).}

\item{strict_branch}{Logical; if TRUE, require positive branch-level treated-only uplift with
CI lower bound > 0 to consider a branch favorable (default FALSE).}

\item{restricted_scope}{Character; one of "leaf" (default) or "branch"; defines the granularity
used to construct the restricted policy (treat inside selected branch/leaf; control elsewhere).}

\description{
Generates a concise textual summary and a markdown table for policy tree results
(typically from `margot_policy_tree_stability()`). The report focuses on:
- Policy value vs control-all and vs treat-all (95% CIs)
- Average uplift among treated (95% CI) and coverage treated (%)
- Optional stability highlights (consensus strength and top split variable)
- Optional split breakdown: per-branch selective uplifts and contributions
}
\details{
Method (estimation and identities):
- For each model and depth, we evaluate the consensus policy on the held-out test set
  used to build `plot_data` (policytree test indices).
- Let μ0(x), μ1(x) be conditional means E[Y(0)|X=x], E[Y(1)|X=x] estimated by
  policytree/GRF. We use `double_robust_scores()` stored in `dr_scores` to obtain
  per-unit estimates for μ0 and μ1 on the test rows, and we predict policy actions a(x)
  from the consensus policy tree. We ensure all quantities are aligned to the same test
  rows by mapping via rownames and a single complete-case mask over the policy columns.
- Policy value contrasts are computed as sample averages (plugin DR estimators):
    PV vs control-all  = mean( 1{a(x)=Treat} × (μ1(x) − μ0(x)) )
    PV vs treat-all    = mean( 1{a(x)=Control} × (μ0(x) − μ1(x)) )
- Treated-only metrics link to these via the identity:
    Coverage = mean(1{a(x)=Treat}), Uplift_Treated = mean(μ1 − μ0 | a(x)=Treat)
    PV vs control-all = Coverage × Uplift_Treated
- Split contributions report the subgroup decomposition of these means over the first split
  (or leaves), and sum exactly to the overall policy values.

Standard errors:
- `se_method = "bootstrap"` (default): bootstrap resampling of the test rows and
  re-prediction of the policy actions to obtain SEs and CIs.
- `se_method = "plugin"`: influence-function plug-in SEs via the sample variance of the
  per-unit contributions (e.g., TreatMask × (μ1−μ0) for PV vs control-all); i.e.,
  se = sd(contribution)/sqrt(n). This mimics the asymptotic SE used by policytree
  for value estimators based on DR pseudo-outcomes when raw (Y, W) are not required.

Automated recommendations (optional):
- When `auto_recommend = TRUE`, the reporter identifies a dominant favorable split (by PV(control-all)
  contribution share) and evaluates a restricted policy that treats only inside that split (keeps
  the learned actions there; forces control elsewhere). It then compares full vs restricted policies
  and emits a recommendation per model: deploy_full, deploy_restricted, caution, or do_not_deploy.

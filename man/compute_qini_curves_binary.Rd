\title{Compute Qini Curves for Binary Treatments}
\usage{
compute_qini_curves_binary(tau_hat, Y, W, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tau_hat}{Numeric vector of estimated treatment effects.}

\item{Y}{Vector or matrix of observed outcomes.}

\item{W}{Vector of treatment assignments (binary).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, print diagnostic information during execution.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
  \item{qini_data}{A data frame containing Qini curve data for plotting.}
  \item{qini_objects}{A list of maq objects for CATE and ATE Qini curves.}
  Returns NULL if an error occurs or if the resulting Qini data is empty.
}
\description{
Computes Qini curves for binary treatments using the maq package. This function
calculates both Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) and Average Treatment
Effect (ATE) Qini curves.
}
\details{
This function computes Qini curves for binary treatments. It handles potential
errors and edge cases, providing verbose output when requested. The function
calculates both CATE and ATE Qini curves using the maq package.

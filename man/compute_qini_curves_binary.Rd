\title{Compute Qini Curves for Binary Treatments Using Doubly Robust Scores}
\usage{
compute_qini_curves_binary(model, tau_hat, Y, W, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted GRF causal forest model.}

\item{tau_hat}{Numeric vector of estimated treatment effects.}

\item{Y}{Vector or matrix of observed outcomes.}

\item{W}{Vector of treatment assignments (binary).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, print diagnostic information during execution.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
  \item{qini_data}{A data frame containing Qini curve data for plotting.}
  \item{qini_objects}{A list of maq objects for CATE and ATE Qini curves.}
  Returns NULL if an error occurs or if the resulting Qini data is empty.
}
\description{
Computes Qini curves for binary treatments using the maq package and doubly robust (DR) scores from GRF.
This function calculates both Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) and Average Treatment
Effect (ATE) Qini curves. A note is printed indicating that DR scores are used.

\title{Compute Qini Curves for Binary Treatments Using Doubly Robust Scores}
\usage{
compute_qini_curves_binary(model, tau_hat, Y, W, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted GRF causal forest model.}

\item{tau_hat}{Numeric vector of estimated treatment effects.}

\item{Y}{Vector or matrix of observed outcomes.}

\item{W}{Vector of treatment assignments (binary).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, print diagnostic information during execution.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
  \item{qini_data}{A data frame containing Qini curve data for plotting.}
  \item{qini_objects}{A list of maq objects for CATE and ATE Qini curves.}
  Returns placeholder objects if calculations fail.
}
\description{
Computes Qini curves for binary treatments using the maq package and doubly robust (DR) scores from GRF.
This function calculates both Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) and Average Treatment
Effect (ATE) Qini curves. The function includes robust error handling and multiple fallback mechanisms
to ensure valid output even when the primary calculation methods fail.
}
\details{
The function first attempts to compute doubly robust scores from the model. If this fails,
it falls back to several alternative methods, progressively simplifying the approach
until valid output structures are produced. This ensures that downstream functions
have the expected data structures available.

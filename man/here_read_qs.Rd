\title{Read Data Frame or Object from qs File in a Specified Directory}
\usage{
here_read_qs(name, dir_path = NULL, nthreads = 1, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Character string specifying the name of the `.qs` file to be read (without the ".qs" extension).}

\item{dir_path}{Character string specifying the directory path from which the file will be read. If NULL (default), uses `push_mods`.}

\item{nthreads}{Integer specifying the number of threads to use for decompression. Default is 1.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If TRUE, suppresses console output. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data frame or object representing the data stored in the specified `.qs` file.
}
\description{
Reads a `.qs` file specified by `name` from a directory defined by `dir_path`, returning the data frame or object stored within.
This function uses the `qs` package to efficiently read `.qs` files and the `here` package to construct the file path in a consistent, platform-independent manner.
}
\details{
If `dir_path` is NULL, the `push_mods` variable must be defined in the user's environment or within the package, pointing to the directory from where files are to be read.
This function will throw an error if the specified file does not exist or cannot be read as a `.qs` file.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `push_mods` is set in your environment to "~/mydata"
# and you have previously saved a `.qs` file named "my_dataset.qs" in that directory
my_df <- here_read_qs("my_dataset")

# Reading from a custom directory with multiple threads
my_df <- here_read_qs("my_dataset", dir_path = "~/custom_dir", nthreads = 4)

}

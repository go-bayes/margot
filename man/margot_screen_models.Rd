\usage{
margot_screen_models(
  model_results,
  rule = c("ate_or_rate", "ate", "rate"),
  target = c("AUTOC", "QINI", "either", "both"),
  alpha = 0.05,
  adjust = c("none", "bonferroni", "holm", "BH", "fdr", "BY")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{List; a margot result containing `$results` with each element
having `ate`, `rate_result`, and `rate_qini` entries.}

\item{rule}{Character; one of:
* "ate_or_rate" – keep if either ATE or the selected rate test is significant;
* "ate"          – keep only if the ATE is significant;
* "rate"         – keep only if the selected rate test is significant.}

\item{target}{Character; which rate metric defines “rate significant?”:
* "AUTOC"  – test only AUTOC rate;
* "QINI"   – test only QINI rate;
* "either" – significant if either AUTOC or QINI passes;
* "both"   – significant only if both AUTOC and QINI pass.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric; two-sided significance level (default 0.05).}

\item{adjust}{Character; multiplicity adjustment method for p-values:
"none", "bonferroni", "holm", "BH"/"fdr", or "BY". Default "none".}
}
\value{
Character vector of outcome names to keep (without the `model_` prefix).
}
\description{
Returns the names of outcome variables whose policy test passes the adjusted threshold,
applying rules based on ATE and rate metrics with optional multiplicity adjustment.
}
\details{
If `adjust != "none"`, p-values for ATE, AUTOC rate, and QINI rate
are each adjusted across outcomes using `stats::p.adjust()`. Significance flags are
determined by comparing adjusted p-values to `alpha`. Outcomes are then filtered
according to `rule` and `target` as described above.

\title{Transition Table}
\usage{
transition_table(data, state_names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with columns `from` and `to` indicating the initial and subsequent
states of entities, respectively, and a `Freq` column indicating the frequency of transitions.}

\item{state_names}{Optional; a vector of state names to replace the default state labels.
If NULL, states will be labeled as "State 1", "State 2", etc., based on the unique values
in `from` and `to` columns.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: `explanation`, a character string explaining the table,
and `table`, a markdown-formatted table of transitions. The diagonal entries (in bold)
represent the count of entities that remained in their initial state, while the off-diagonal
entries show the count of transitions between different states.
}
\description{
Generates a transition table that describes movements and stability between states
from one observation to the next. It formats the output as a markdown table, highlighting
the number of entities remaining in the same state (diagonal) and those transitioning
to different states (off-diagonal).

# Assuming `transition_matrix` is a table with the transition counts between states
# First, convert `transition_matrix` to a dataframe suitable for `transition_table`

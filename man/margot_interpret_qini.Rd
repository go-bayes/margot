\arguments{
\item{multi_batch}{List output from margot_batch_policy() with diff_gain_summaries.}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list mapping model names to readable labels.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for confidence intervals. Default is 0.05.}

\item{decimal_places}{Number of decimal places for rounding. Default is 2.}

\item{model_names}{Optional character vector specifying models to process.
Default is NULL (i.e. process all).}

\description{
This function interprets Qini results for both binary and multi-arm treatments.
It detects the treatment type based on the input data structure and calls the
appropriate sub-function. A new parameter, \code{model_names}, restricts the
analysis to the specified models; if not supplied, all models are processed.

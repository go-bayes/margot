\title{Create Ordered Variable Based on Quantile Breaks or Custom Breaks with Informative Labels}
\usage{
create_ordered_variable(
  df,
  var_name,
  n_divisions = NULL,
  cutpoint_inclusive = "upper",
  ties.method = NULL,
  custom_breaks = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the variable to be divided into categories.}

\item{var_name}{The name of the variable within the data frame to divide into categories.}

\item{n_divisions}{The number of quantile divisions to create. Required if custom_breaks is not provided.}

\item{cutpoint_inclusive}{A character string specifying whether cutpoints should be included
in the lower or upper category. Must be either "lower" or "upper". Default is "upper".}

\item{ties.method}{A character string specifying how ties should be handled when calculating quantiles.
Must be one of "first", "last", "random", "ordered", or "average".
If NULL (default), it will be set to "last" if cutpoint_inclusive is "upper",
and "first" if cutpoint_inclusive is "lower".}

\item{custom_breaks}{A numeric vector of break points to use for categorization. If provided,
this overrides the quantile-based division specified by n_divisions.}
}
\value{
The input data frame with an additional column representing the ordered factor variable.
        The new column name will be the original variable name with "_cat" appended.
}
\description{
This function divides a numeric variable into categories based on either quantile breaks
or custom-specified breaks, and creates an ordered factor variable with informative labels.
It now includes rich CLI reporting for better user feedback.

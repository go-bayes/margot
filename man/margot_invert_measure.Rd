\title{Invert Measure Values for Reverse Scoring}
\usage{
margot_invert_measure(x, method = c("zscore", "ordinal"), scale_bounds = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of values to invert}

\item{method}{Character string specifying inversion method:
- "zscore": Simple negation for already standardized data (default)
- "ordinal": Invert on ordinal scale using bounds}

\item{scale_bounds}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying [min, max] bounds
for ordinal scale inversion. Required when method = "ordinal".
If NULL and method = "ordinal", bounds are inferred from data range.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of inverted values
}
\description{
Inverts measure values using either z-score negation or ordinal scale inversion.
This function is used internally by margot_causal_forest when flip_outcomes
is specified.
}
\details{
Z-score method:
Simply negates the values: x_flipped = -x
This assumes the input data is already standardized (z-scores).
For raw data that needs standardization, consider using scale() first.

Ordinal method:
Uses the formula: x_flipped = (max + min) - x
This preserves distances between values while reversing their order.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# z-score inversion (for already standardized data)
z_scores <- scale(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))[, 1] # standardize first
margot_invert_measure(z_scores, method = "zscore")

# ordinal scale inversion with known bounds
likert <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2)
margot_invert_measure(likert, method = "ordinal", scale_bounds = c(1, 5))

# ordinal scale inversion with inferred bounds
margot_invert_measure(likert, method = "ordinal")
}

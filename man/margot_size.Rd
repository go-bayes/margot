\title{Calculate the size of an R object in megabytes}
\usage{
margot_size(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An R object whose size you want to measure}
}
\value{
A character string representing the size of the object in MB,
        formatted to two decimal places
}
\description{
This function takes an R object and returns its size in megabytes (MB).
It's useful for understanding the memory footprint of large data structures
or complex objects in your R environment.
}
\note{
KEY MESSAGE: Monitoring object sizes is crucial for efficient memory
      management, especially when working with large datasets or complex
      analyses. Use this function to keep track of memory usage and optimize
      your R code for better performance.

margot_qini(
  models,

}
\arguments{
\item{models}{List returned by margot_causal_forest(), containing results
and optionally full_models.}

\item{model_names}{Optional character vector specifying which models to process.
Default NULL (all models).}

\item{spend_levels}{Numeric vector of spend levels for difference gain summaries.
Default is 0.1 (10 percent spend captures early heterogeneity patterns effectively).}

\item{baseline_method}{Method for generating baseline: "maq_no_covariates" (default), 
"auto", "simple", "maq_only", or "none". See margot_generate_qini_data() for details.}

\item{label_mapping}{Named character vector for converting variable names to readable labels.}

\item{remove_tx_prefix}{Logical; remove treatment prefix from variable names (default TRUE).}

\item{remove_z_suffix}{Logical; remove z-score suffix from variable names (default TRUE).}

\item{use_title_case}{Logical; convert variable names to title case (default TRUE).}

\item{remove_underscores}{Logical; replace underscores with spaces (default TRUE).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print progress messages (default TRUE).}

\item{seed}{Integer; base seed for reproducible computations (default 12345).}

\item{treatment_cost}{Scalar treatment cost per unit. Default 1. Lower values (e.g., 0.2)
represent cheap treatments; higher values (e.g., 5) represent expensive treatments.
Affects QINI curve shape - lower costs create steeper curves, higher costs create
shallower curves.}
}
\value{
A list where each element corresponds to a model and contains:
  qini_objects (maq objects for CATE and baseline curves),
  qini_data (data.frame with proportion, gain, and curve columns for plotting),
  diff_gain_summaries (list of difference gain summaries at each spend level),
  model_name (the processed model name).
}
\description{
Computes QINI curves and difference gain summaries for causal forest models.
This function provides a direct way to generate QINI results without running
full policy analysis, paralleling the functionality of margot_rate().
}
\details{
This function generates QINI curves on-demand using margot_generate_qini_data().
For binary treatments, it creates both CATE and baseline (e.g., ATE) curves.
The difference gain summaries quantify how much better CATE-based targeting
performs compared to the baseline at specified spend levels.

The treatment_cost parameter allows for cost sensitivity analysis without
rerunning the causal forest models. Lower costs (e.g., 0.2) create steeper
QINI curves indicating more people can be treated cost-effectively, while
higher costs (e.g., 5) create shallower curves indicating only the highest-effect
individuals justify treatment.

Cost Invariance Property: When treatment costs are uniform across 
individuals, the relative benefit of CATE-based targeting over uniform allocation 
remains constant regardless of cost level. While absolute gains scale inversely 
with cost (gain at cost c = gain at cost 1 / c), the difference between CATE 
and ATE curves scales proportionally, preserving the relative advantage of 
personalized treatment. This means the value of heterogeneous treatment effects 
for targeting decisions is independent of the uniform cost level.

The output is structured to be compatible with margot_interpret_qini() and
other QINI visualization functions.

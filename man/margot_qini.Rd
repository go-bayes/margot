\description{
Computes QINI curves and difference gain summaries for causal forest models.
This function provides a direct way to generate QINI results without running
full policy analysis, paralleling the functionality of margot_rate().

Computes QINI curves for causal forest models using the exact methodology
from GRF/MAQ packages. Uses test set data when train/test splits were used
in margot_causal_forest().

This function provides backward compatibility for margot_interpret_qini by
formatting the output of margot_qini_alternative into the expected structure.
}
\details{
This function generates QINI curves on-demand using margot_generate_qini_data().
For binary treatments, it creates both CATE and baseline (e.g., ATE) curves.
The difference gain summaries quantify how much better CATE-based targeting
performs compared to the baseline at specified spend levels.

The treatment_cost parameter allows for cost sensitivity analysis without
rerunning the causal forest models. Lower costs (e.g., 0.2) create steeper
QINI curves indicating more people can be treated cost-effectively, while
higher costs (e.g., 5) create shallower curves indicating only the highest-effect
individuals justify treatment.

Cost Invariance Property: When treatment costs are uniform across 
individuals, the relative benefit of CATE-based targeting over uniform allocation 
remains constant regardless of cost level. While absolute gains scale inversely 
with cost (gain at cost c = gain at cost 1 / c), the difference between CATE 
and ATE curves scales proportionally, preserving the relative advantage of 
personalized treatment. This means the value of heterogeneous treatment effects 
for targeting decisions is independent of the uniform cost level.

The output is structured to be compatible with margot_interpret_qini() and
other QINI visualization functions.

This function implements the standard QINI curve methodology from the GRF
and MAQ packages. It computes two curves:

1. CATE curve: Prioritizes treatment based on estimated individual treatment effects
2. Baseline curve: No-priority assignment (random allocation)

When margot_causal_forest() was run with use_train_test_split = TRUE,
QINI curves are computed on the test set only, following best practices
for avoiding overfitting in policy evaluation.

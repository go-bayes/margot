\description{
This function is a wrapper for grf::multi_arm_causal_forest that runs multiple GRF multi-arm causal forest models
for specified outcome variables. It calculates average treatment effects, creates custom evaluation tables,
and includes additional features such as tau.hat estimates, policy trees, variable importance rankings,
and Qini curves. It also prepares data for policy tree visualization, using a specified proportion of the data for training.
}
\note{
Setting save_models = TRUE typically results in very large objects (often several GB).
      Ensure you have sufficient memory available when using this option.

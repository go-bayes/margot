\title{Batch Plot QINI Curves Across Treatment Costs for Multiple Models}
\usage{
margot_plot_qini_batch_cost_sensitivity(
  models,
  costs = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5),
  model_names = NULL,
  plot_type = c("grid", "list", "combined"),
  spend_levels = c(0.1, 0.4),
  baseline_method = "maq_no_covariates",
  label_mapping = NULL,
  ncol = NULL,
  heights = NULL,
  widths = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  x_axis = "budget",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{List returned by margot_causal_forest(), containing results
and optionally full_models.}

\item{costs}{Numeric vector of treatment costs to evaluate. Default is
c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) representing a range from cheap to expensive treatments.}

\item{model_names}{Optional character vector specifying which models to process.
Default NULL (all models).}

\item{plot_type}{Character; how to arrange the plots:
- "grid": Arrange in a grid with models as rows and costs as columns
- "list": Return a nested list of individual plots
- "combined": Create a single combined plot with facets
Default is "grid".}

\item{spend_levels}{Numeric vector of spend levels for annotations.
Default is c(0.1, 0.4).}

\item{baseline_method}{Method for generating baseline. See margot_qini() for details.
Default is "maq_no_covariates".}

\item{label_mapping}{Named character vector for converting variable names to readable labels.}

\item{ncol}{For plot_type = "grid", number of columns in the grid. Default NULL
uses the number of costs.}

\item{heights}{For plot_type = "grid", relative heights of rows. Default NULL
gives equal heights.}

\item{widths}{For plot_type = "grid", relative widths of columns. Default NULL
gives equal widths.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print progress messages (default TRUE).}

\item{x_axis}{Type of x-axis for QINI curves: "proportion" or "budget" (default).
"budget" shows budget per unit (matching maq visualization) which better
illustrates the effect of different treatment costs.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to margot_plot_qini().}
}
\value{
Depending on plot_type:
- "grid": A combined plot object (requires patchwork package)
- "list": A nested list where first level is model names, second level is costs
- "combined": A single ggplot object with facets
}
\description{
Creates visualizations showing how QINI curves change with treatment cost for
multiple models simultaneously. This function combines the functionality of
margot_qini_cost_sensitivity() and margot_plot_qini_batch() to create comprehensive
cost sensitivity visualizations.
}
\details{
This function efficiently generates QINI curves for multiple models at different
treatment costs, enabling comprehensive cost sensitivity analysis. The plots
help identify:
- Which models are most sensitive to treatment cost
- Cost thresholds where targeting becomes ineffective
- Optimal cost-benefit trade-offs for different outcomes

# Create grid of plots for all models

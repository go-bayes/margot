\arguments{
\item{plot_output}{Either a plot object directly, or a list containing a plot element.
Supported plot types include ggplot objects, base R plot objects, and others.}

\item{prefix}{Character string. A prefix to add to the filename. Default is NULL.}

\item{base_filename}{Character string. The base name for the saved file. Default is "plot".}

\item{save_path}{Character string. The directory path where the image will be saved.
Default is here::here("push_mods").}

\item{width}{Numeric. The width of the saved image in inches. Default is 16.}

\item{height}{Numeric. The height of the saved image in inches. Default is 8.}

\item{dpi}{Numeric. The resolution of the saved image in dots per inch. Default is 500.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path of the saved file.

Invisibly returns the path of the saved file.

\description{
This function takes the output of either `margot_plot()` or `margot_plot_multi_arm()`
and saves the plot as a PNG image using `ggsave()`.

This function saves a plot object as a PNG image, supporting multiple plotting systems
including ggplot2, base R plots, and other plotting libraries.
}
\details{
This function uses `ggsave()` to save the Margot plot as a PNG image.
If the save_path directory doesn't exist, it will be created.
The final filename will be constructed as: `{prefix}_{base_filename}.png`.

This function handles different types of plot objects and saves them as PNG images:
- For ggplot2 objects: Uses ggsave()
- For other plot types: Uses png() and dev.off()
The final filename will be constructed as: `{prefix}_{base_filename}.png`.

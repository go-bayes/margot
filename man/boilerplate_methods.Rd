\title{Generate Methods Section for a Causal Inference Study}
\usage{
boilerplate_methods(
  exposure_var,
  outcome_vars,
  n_total,
  baseline_wave,
  exposure_wave,
  outcome_wave,
  baseline_missing_data_proportion,
  sections_to_include = "all",
  appendices_measures = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exposure_var}{Character string specifying the primary exposure variable.}

\item{outcome_vars}{A named list of character vectors specifying the outcome variables by domain.}

\item{n_total}{Numeric value indicating the total number of participants in the study.}

\item{baseline_wave}{Character string specifying the baseline wave of the study.}

\item{exposure_wave}{Character string specifying the exposure wave of the study.}

\item{outcome_wave}{Character string specifying the outcome wave of the study.}

\item{baseline_missing_data_proportion}{Numeric value indicating the proportion of missing data at baseline.}

\item{sections_to_include}{Character vector specifying which sections to include in the output.
Default is 'all', which includes all available sections. Use 'list' to see available sections.}

\item{appendices_measures}{Character string specifying the appendix where detailed variable descriptions can be found.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to helper functions.}

\item{measure_data}{A list containing information about each measure.}
}
\value{
If sections_to_include is not 'list', returns a character string containing the generated methods
  section in markdown format. If sections_to_include is 'list', returns a character vector of available sections.
}
\description{
This function generates a comprehensive methods section for a research paper,
including details about the sample, variables, causal interventions,
identification assumptions, target population, eligibility criteria,
confounding control, missing data handling, statistical estimators,
and additional sections like sensitivity analysis and scope of interventions.

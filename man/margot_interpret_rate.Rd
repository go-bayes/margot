\title{Interpret Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect (RATE) estimates}
\usage{
margot_interpret_rate(rate_df, flipped_outcomes = NULL, target = "AUTOC")
}
\arguments{
\item{rate_df}{A data frame from \code{margot_rate()} with columns:
\code{RATE Estimate}, \code{2.5\%}, and \code{97.5\%}. The first column contains outcome names.
Alternatively, a list containing both AUTOC and QINI results.}

\item{flipped_outcomes}{Character vector of outcome names that were inverted during pre-processing.}

\item{target}{Character string specifying RATE type: \code{AUTOC} (default) or \code{QINI}.
Ignored if \code{rate_df} is a list containing both methods.}
}
\value{
A markdown string interpreting the RATE estimates.
}
\description{
This function provides a concise interpretation of Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect (RATE)
estimates from \code{margot_rate()}. The RATE evaluates a prioritisation policy based on the
estimated conditional treatment effect, \eqn{\tau(x)}, which reflects the expected gain conditional
on measured covariates. For AUTOC the logarithmic weighting is most effective when heterogeneity
is concentrated in a small subset of individuals (typically â‰¤ 10%), whereas for QINI the linear
weighting is most effective when heterogeneity is broadly distributed (typically > 50%).

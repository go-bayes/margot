\title{Post-process models to recover Qini curves via propensity trimming}
\usage{
margot_rescue_qini(
  model_results,
  propensity_bounds = c(0.05, 0.95),
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{a list from margot_causal_forest() with
save_models = TRUE and save_data = TRUE}

\item{propensity_bounds}{numeric length‑2 vector of lower/upper
bounds for forest$W.hat (default c(0.05, 0.95))}

\item{verbose}{logical; if TRUE prints progress messages (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
modified model_results with rescued qini_data and qini_objects
  for any models that initially had empty gain
}
\description{
for any model in a results list whose qini_objects are null or empty,
this function applies an overlap restriction on the estimated\ n#' propensity scores and recomputes in‑sample Qini curves on the trimmed data,
without touching the original ATE or forest objects.

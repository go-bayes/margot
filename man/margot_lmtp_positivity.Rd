\title{Summarize positivity via density ratios for LMTP fits}
\usage{
margot_lmtp_positivity(
  x,
  thresholds = c(10, 25, 50, 100),
  probs = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.5, 0.95, 0.999),
  ess_warn = 0.5,
  zero_warn = 0.01,
  tail_warn = c(`10` = 0.05, `25` = 0.02, `50` = 0.01, `100` = 0.005),
  include_overall = TRUE,
  digits = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either:
- the full result of `margot_lmtp()` (list with $models),
- a single LMTP model fit (must have $density_ratios),
- or a numeric vector/matrix of density ratios.}

\item{thresholds}{Numeric vector of tail thresholds to report (P(ratio > threshold)).}

\item{probs}{Quantiles to report (must include 0.5 if you want the median).}

\item{ess_warn}{Flag when ESS/N is below this fraction (per wave).}

\item{zero_warn}{Flag when proportion of exact zeros exceeds this fraction.}

\item{tail_warn}{Named numeric vector giving tail-mass flag thresholds
(names must match thresholds). If length 1, recycled to all thresholds.}

\item{include_overall}{If TRUE, also compute an overall summary pooling all waves.}

\item{digits}{Optional integer for rounding in the returned data frames (NULL = no rounding).}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, prints concise CLI messages when flags are raised.}
}
\value{
A list with:
  \item{by_wave}{data.frame of per-wave summaries (one row per outcome/shift/wave).
    Columns include both all-observations metrics and uncensored-only (`*_pos`) metrics.}
  \item{overall}{data.frame of pooled summaries across waves (one row per outcome/shift).
    Also includes `*_pos` columns for uncensored diagnostics.}
  \item{flags}{data.frame of flagged issues (subset of rows from by_wave/overall with reasons).}
}
\description{
Computes by-wave and overall summaries of density ratios, including
zeros, extreme quantiles, tail mass above thresholds, and effective sample size (ESS).

\details{
**Censoring vs. Treatment Positivity:** In longitudinal LMTP, zeros (\eqn{r_t = 0})
in density ratios primarily reflect **censoring** (dropout) rather than treatment
positivity violations. When an individual is censored at time \eqn{t}, they have no
observed treatment at subsequent waves, yielding \eqn{r_t = 0} in the numerator
regardless of the policy. These censoring-induced zeros appear identically across
all policies for the same individual.

In contrast, true **treatment positivity violations** are policy-specific: an observed
treatment trajectory may be incompatible with one policy but not another. To distinguish
these cases, this function computes metrics for both all observations (including zeros)
and **uncensored observations** (\eqn{r > 0}), with the latter denoted by `*_pos` suffixes
in column names. The `prop_zero` column reports the censoring rate per wave.

\examples{
# Single model:
# pos <- margot_lmtp_positivity(fit$models$outcome$shift_model)
#
# Entire run from margot_lmtp():
# pos <- margot_lmtp_positivity(fit)
# head(pos$by_wave); head(pos$flags)

\title{Assess Variable Correlations for Policy Tree Analysis}
\usage{
margot_assess_variable_correlation(
  model_results,
  model_name,
  correlation_threshold = 0.5,
  method = c("pearson", "spearman", "kendall"),
  plot = TRUE,
  label_mapping = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results}{List returned by margot_causal_forest() (not bootstrap results).
Must have been run with save_data = TRUE to access covariate data.}

\item{model_name}{Character string specifying which model to analyze}

\item{correlation_threshold}{Numeric threshold for considering variables correlated (default 0.5)}

\item{method}{Correlation method: "pearson", "spearman", or "kendall" (default "pearson")}

\item{plot}{Logical: Create correlation heatmap (default TRUE)}

\item{label_mapping}{Optional named list mapping variable names to labels. If NULL,
uses automatic transformation via transform_var_name()}
}
\value{
List containing:
\itemize{
  \item correlation_matrix: Full correlation matrix (with labelled row/column names)
  \item high_correlations: Pairs of variables with |r| > threshold (with labels)
  \item correlation_clusters: Groups of intercorrelated variables (with labels)
  \item summary_text: Narrative summary of findings (using labels)
}
}
\description{
Analyzes correlations among covariates used in policy tree analysis.
This helps identify groups of correlated variables that may substitute
for each other in tree splits, explaining apparent instability.

# margot

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The margot package is undergoing refactoring as we transition to the **margotverse** suite of packages. The package will be split into focuse. Please expect breaking changes in upcoming releases.

**MARG**inal **O**bservational **T**reatment-effects.[^1]

Causal inference requires **balance** across the treatments to be
compared. In observational studies, such balance is not guaranteed;
quantifying causality therefore requires careful, multi-step workflows.

The goal of `margot` is to enhance understanding of causality in observational research.

The package offers functions for:

- evaluating causal assumptions
- modelling time-series data
- reporting results
- performing sensitivity analyses

`margot` streamlines the estimation of (Marginal) Average Treatment Effects (ATT, ATE), but it also supports workflows for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (CATE) (estimated via `grf`), as well as Longitudinal Modified Treatment Policies (estimated via `lmtp`). It has extensive graphical and reporting functions to ease burdens for understanding. 

## LMTP positivity diagnostics

For longitudinal overlap checks, `margot_plot_lmtp_overlap_grid()` now:

- Automatically arranges panels by **shifts × waves** and respects the shift order you request.
- Uses the expanded "lab" palette (grey `null`, blue `shift_zero`, distinct oranges for IPSI shifts) so panels stay visually consistent across waves.
- Applies sensible defaults for headroom and axis harmonisation—no need to hand-tune `layout`, `ymax_harmonize`, or `xlim_harmonize`.
- Treats the legacy `layout` argument as deprecated: it always reverts to the stable shifts-by-waves layout (with a CLI note if a different value is supplied).

Pair these plots with `margot_interpret_lmtp_positivity()` for per-wave ESS and tail diagnostics computed on uncensored weights.

[^1]: The logo is a *Single World Intervention Template* (SWIT). We use
    a SWIT to generate *Single World Intervention Graphs* (SWIGs) –
    causal diagrams for which identification assumptions can be read
    separately for each treatment (regime) to be compared. The name
    `margot` reflects the contents and aims of this package; it is also
    the name of my daughter, Margot.

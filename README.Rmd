# margot

**MARG**inal **O**bservational **T**reatment-effects.[^1]


Causal inference requires **balance** across the treatments to be compared. In observational studies, such balance is not guaranteed. The goal of `margot` is to enhance the accessibility of causal inference. Its primary audience includes psychological scientists, although it may benefit other social scientists.

The package offers functions for:

- evaluating causal assumptions
- modelling time-series data
- reporting results
- performing sensitivity analyses

`margot` focuses on streamlining the estimation of (Marginal) Average Treatment Effects, but it also supports workflows for Conditional Average Treatment Effects, Heterogeneous Treatment Effects, and Modified Treatment Policies.

[^1]: The name `margot` reflects the contents of this package; it is also the name of my daughter, Margot.



This version of the package is a work in progress and experimental.



## Installation

You can install the development version of `margot` like so:

```r
if (!require(devtools, quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}

devtools::install_github("go-bayes/margot")
```

## Example

```r
library("margot")

# create transition table to evaluate the positivity assumption
transition_matrix <- create_transition_matrix(df_nz, "religion_believe_god", "id")

# create table and table explanation
table_change_belief <- transition_table(transition_matrix)
table_change_belief
```

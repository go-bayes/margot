# margot

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This development version of the margot package is undergoing significant refactoring as we transition to the **margotverse** suite of packages. This package is currently for the author's lab use only. The package will be split into focused, single-responsibility packages including margot.core, margot.lmtp, margot.grf, margot.viz, and others. Please expect breaking changes in upcoming releases.

**MARG**inal **O**bservational **T**reatment-effects.[^1]

Causal inference requires **balance** across the treatments to be
compared. In observational studies, such balance is not guaranteed;
quantifying causality therefore requires careful, multi-step workflows.

The goal of `margot` is to enhance understanding of causality in observational research.

The package offers functions for:

- evaluating causal assumptions
- modelling time-series data
- reporting results
- performing sensitivity analyses

`margot` focuses on streamlining the estimation of (Marginal) Average
Treatment Effects (ATT, ATE), but it also supports workflows for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (CATE) (estimated via `grf`), as well as Longitudinal Modified Treatment Policies (estimated via `lmtp`). It has extensive graphical and reporting functions to ease burdens for understanding. 

[^1]: The logo is a *Single World Intervention Template* (SWIT). We use
    a SWIT to generate *Single World Intervention Graphs* (SWIGs) –
    causal diagrams for which identification assumptions can be read
    separately for each treatment (regime) to be compared. The name
    `margot` reflects the contents and aims of this package; it is also
    the name of my daughter, Margot.
